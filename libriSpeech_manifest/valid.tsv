dev-clean/1272/128104/1272-128104-0000.flac	mister quilter is the apostle of the middle classes and we are glad to welcome his gospel	1272
dev-clean/1272/128104/1272-128104-0001.flac	nor is mister quilters manner less interesting than his matter	1272
dev-clean/1272/128104/1272-128104-0002.flac	he tells us that at this festive season of the year with christmas and roast beef looming before us similes drawn from eating and its results occur most readily to the mind	1272
dev-clean/1272/128104/1272-128104-0003.flac	he has grave doubts whether sir frederick leightons work is really greek after all and can discover in it but little of rocky ithaca	1272
dev-clean/1272/128104/1272-128104-0004.flac	linnells pictures are a sort of up guards and at em paintings and masons exquisite idylls are as national as a jingo poem mister birket fosters landscapes smile at one much in the same way that mister carker used to flash his teeth and mister john collier gives his sitter a cheerful slap on the back before he says like a shampooer in a turkish bath next man	1272
dev-clean/1272/128104/1272-128104-0005.flac	it is obviously unnecessary for us to point out how luminous these criticisms are how delicate in expression	1272
dev-clean/1272/128104/1272-128104-0006.flac	on the general principles of art mister quilter writes with equal lucidity	1272
dev-clean/1272/128104/1272-128104-0007.flac	painting he tells us is of a different quality to mathematics and finish in art is adding more fact	1272
dev-clean/1272/128104/1272-128104-0008.flac	as for etchings they are of two kinds british and foreign	1272
dev-clean/1272/128104/1272-128104-0009.flac	he laments most bitterly the divorce that has been made between decorative art and what we usually call pictures makes the customary appeal to the last judgment and reminds us that in the great days of art michael angelo was the furnishing upholsterer	1272
dev-clean/1272/128104/1272-128104-0010.flac	near the fire and the ornaments fred brought home from india on the mantel board	1272
dev-clean/1272/128104/1272-128104-0011.flac	in fact he is quite severe on mister ruskin for not recognising that a picture should denote the frailty of man and remarks with pleasing courtesy and felicitous grace that many phases of feeling	1272
dev-clean/1272/128104/1272-128104-0012.flac	only unfortunately his own work never does get good	1272
dev-clean/1272/128104/1272-128104-0013.flac	mister quilter has missed his chance for he has failed even to make himself the tupper of painting	1272

dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0000.flac	because you were sleeping instead of conquering the lovely rose princess has become a fiddle without a bow while poor shaggy sits there a cooing dove	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0001.flac	he has gone and gone for good answered polychrome who had managed to squeeze into the room beside the dragon and had witnessed the occurrences with much interest	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0002.flac	i have remained a prisoner only because i wished to be one and with this he stepped forward and burst the stout chains as easily as if they had been threads	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0003.flac	the little girl had been asleep but she heard the raps and opened the door	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0004.flac	the king has fled in disgrace and your friends are asking for you	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0005.flac	i begged ruggedo long ago to send him away but he would not do so	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0006.flac	i also offered to help your brother to escape but he would not go	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0007.flac	he eats and sleeps very steadily replied the new king	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0008.flac	i hope he doesnt work too hard said shaggy	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0009.flac	he doesnt work at all	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0010.flac	in fact there is nothing he can do in these dominions as well as our nomes whose numbers are so great that it worries us to keep them all busy	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0011.flac	not exactly returned kaliko	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0012.flac	where is my brother now	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0013.flac	inquired shaggy in the metal forest	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0014.flac	where is that	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0015.flac	the metal forest is in the great domed cavern the largest in all our dominions replied kaliko	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0016.flac	kaliko hesitated	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0017.flac	however if we look sharp we may be able to discover one of these secret ways	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0018.flac	oh no im quite sure he didnt	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0019.flac	thats funny remarked betsy thoughtfully	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0020.flac	i dont believe ann knew any magic or shed have worked it before	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0021.flac	i do not know confessed shaggy	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0022.flac	true agreed kaliko	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0023.flac	kaliko went to the big gong and pounded on it just as ruggedo used to do but no one answered the summons	1272
dev-clean/1272/135031/1272-135031-0024.flac	having returned to the royal cavern kaliko first pounded the gong and then sat in the throne wearing ruggedos discarded ruby crown and holding in his hand the sceptre which ruggedo had so often thrown at his head	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0000.flac	a man said to the universe sir i exist	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0001.flac	sweat covered brions body trickling into the tight loincloth that was the only garment he wore	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0002.flac	the cut on his chest still dripping blood the ache of his overstrained eyes even the soaring arena around him with the thousands of spectators were trivialities not worth thinking about	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0003.flac	his instant of panic was followed by a small sharp blow high on his chest	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0004.flac	one minute a voice said and the time buzzer sounded	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0005.flac	a minute is not a very large measure of time and his body needed every fraction of it	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0006.flac	the buzzers whirr triggered his muscles into complete relaxation	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0007.flac	only his heart and lungs worked on at a strong measured rate	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0008.flac	he was in reverie sliding along the borders of consciousness	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0009.flac	the contestants in the twenties needed undisturbed rest therefore nights in the dormitories were as quiet as death	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0010.flac	particularly so on this last night when only two of the little cubicles were occupied the thousands of others standing with dark empty doors	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0011.flac	the other voice snapped with a harsh urgency clearly used to command	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0012.flac	im here because the matter is of utmost importance and brandd is the one i must see now stand aside	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0013.flac	the twenties	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0014.flac	he must have drawn his gun because the intruder said quickly put that away youre being a fool out	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0015.flac	there was silence then and still wondering brion was once more asleep	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0016.flac	ten seconds	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0017.flac	he asked the handler who was kneading his aching muscles	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0018.flac	a red haired mountain of a man with an apparently inexhaustible store of energy	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0019.flac	there could be little art in this last and final round of fencing	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0020.flac	just thrust and parry and victory to the stronger	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0021.flac	every man who entered the twenties had his own training tricks	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0022.flac	there appeared to be an immediate association with the death trauma as if the two were inextricably linked into one	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0023.flac	the strength that enables someone in a trance to hold his body stiff and unsupported except at two points the head and heels	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0024.flac	this is physically impossible when conscious	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0025.flac	others had died before during the twenties and death during the last round was in some ways easier than defeat	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0026.flac	breathing deeply brion softly spoke the auto hypnotic phrases that triggered the process	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0027.flac	when the buzzer sounded he pulled his foil from his seconds startled grasp and ran forward	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0028.flac	irolg looked amazed at the sudden fury of the attack then smiled	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0029.flac	he thought it was a last burst of energy he knew how close they both were to exhaustion	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0030.flac	brion saw something close to panic on his opponents face when the man finally recognized his error	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0031.flac	a wave of despair rolled out from irolg brion sensed it and knew the fifth point was his	1272
dev-clean/1272/141231/1272-141231-0032.flac	then the powerful twist that thrust it aside in and under the guard	1272
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0000.flac	he had written a number of books himself among them a history of dancing a history of costume a key to shakespeares sonnets a study of the poetry of ernest dowson et cetera	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0001.flac	hughs written a delightful part for her and shes quite inexpressible	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0002.flac	i happen to have mac connells box for tonight or thered be no chance of our getting places	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0003.flac	alexander exclaimed mildly	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0004.flac	myself i always knew she had it in her	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0005.flac	do you know alexander mainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger do you know i sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0006.flac	when they entered the stage box on the left the first act was well under way the scene being the interior of a cabin in the south of ireland	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0007.flac	as they sat down a burst of applause drew alexanders attention to the stage	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0008.flac	of course hilda is irish the burgoynes have been stage people for generations and she has the irish voice	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0009.flac	its delightful to hear it in a london theatre	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0010.flac	when she began to dance by way of showing the gossoons what she had seen in the fairy rings at night the house broke into a prolonged uproar	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0011.flac	after her dance she withdrew from the dialogue and retreated to the ditch wall back of phillys burrow where she sat singing the rising of the moon and making a wreath of primroses for her donkey	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0012.flac	mac connell let me introduce mister bartley alexander	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0013.flac	the playwright gave mainhall a curious look out of his deep set faded eyes and made a wry face	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0014.flac	he nodded curtly and made for the door dodging acquaintances as he went	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0015.flac	i dare say its quite true that theres never been any one else	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0016.flac	hes another whos awfully keen about her let me introduce you	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0017.flac	sir harry towne bowed and said that he had met mister alexander and his wife in tokyo	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0018.flac	i say sir harry the little girls going famously to night isnt she	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0019.flac	the fact is shes feeling rather seedy poor child	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0020.flac	a little attack of nerves possibly	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0021.flac	he bowed as the warning bell rang and mainhall whispered you know lord westmere of course the stooped man with the long gray mustache talking to lady dowle	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0022.flac	in a moment peggy was on the stage again and alexander applauded vigorously with the rest	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0023.flac	in the half light he looked about at the stalls and boxes and smiled a little consciously recalling with amusement sir harrys judicial frown	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0024.flac	he leaned forward and beamed felicitations as warmly as mainhall himself when at the end of the play she came again and again before the curtain panting a little and flushed her eyes dancing and her eager nervous little mouth tremulous with excitement	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0025.flac	all the same he lifted his glass heres to you little hilda	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0026.flac	im glad shes held her own since	1462
dev-clean/1462/170138/1462-170138-0027.flac	it was youth and poverty and proximity and everything was young and kindly	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0000.flac	the last two days of the voyage bartley found almost intolerable	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0001.flac	emerging at euston at half past three oclock in the afternoon alexander had his luggage sent to the savoy and drove at once to bedford square	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0002.flac	she blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0003.flac	the room was empty when he entered	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0004.flac	a coal fire was crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit for it was already beginning to grow dark outside	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0005.flac	she called his name on the threshold but in her swift flight across the room she felt a change in him and caught herself up so deftly that he could not tell just when she did it	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0006.flac	she merely brushed his cheek with her lips and put a hand lightly and joyously on either shoulder	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0007.flac	i never dreamed it would be you bartley	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0008.flac	when did you come bartley and how did it happen you havent spoken a word	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0009.flac	she looked at his heavy shoulders and big determined head thrust forward like a catapult in leash	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0010.flac	ill do anything you wish me to bartley she said tremulously	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0011.flac	he pulled up a window as if the air were heavy	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0012.flac	hilda watched him from her corner trembling and scarcely breathing dark shadows growing about her eyes	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0013.flac	it it hasnt always made you miserable has it	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0014.flac	always but its worse now	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0015.flac	its unbearable it tortures me every minute	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0016.flac	i am not a man who can live two lives he went on feverishly each life spoils the other	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0017.flac	i get nothing but misery out of either	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0018.flac	there is this deception between me and everything	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0019.flac	at that word deception spoken with such self contempt the color flashed back into hildas face as suddenly as if she had been struck by a whiplash	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0020.flac	she bit her lip and looked down at her hands which were clasped tightly in front of her	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0021.flac	could you could you sit down and talk about it quietly bartley as if i were a friend and not some one who had to be defied	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0022.flac	he dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0023.flac	i have thought about it until i am worn out	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0024.flac	after the very first	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0025.flac	hildas face quivered but she whispered yes i think it must have been	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0026.flac	she pressed his hand gently in gratitude werent you happy then at all	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0027.flac	something of their troubling sweetness came back to alexander too	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0028.flac	presently it stole back to his coat sleeve	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0029.flac	yes hilda i know that he said simply	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0030.flac	i understand bartley i was wrong	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0031.flac	she listened intently but she heard nothing but the creaking of his chair	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0032.flac	you want me to say it she whispered	1462
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462-170142-0033.flac	bartley leaned his head in his hands and spoke through his teeth	1462

dev-clean/1673/143396/1673-143396-0000.flac	a laudable regard for the honor of the first proselyte has countenanced the belief the hope the wish that the ebionites or at least the nazarenes were distinguished only by their obstinate perseverance in the practice of the mosaic rites	1673

dev-clean/1673/143396/1673-143396-0002.flac	yet the most charitable criticism must refuse these sectaries any knowledge of the pure and proper divinity of christ	1673

dev-clean/1673/143396/1673-143396-0007.flac	but the prevailing doctrine of the eternity and inherent pravity of matter infected the primitive churches of the east	1673
dev-clean/1673/143396/1673-143396-0008.flac	many among the gentile proselytes refused to believe that a celestial spirit an undivided portion of the first essence had been personally united with a mass of impure and contaminated flesh and in their zeal for the divinity they piously abjured the humanity of christ	1673
dev-clean/1673/143396/1673-143396-0009.flac	he first appeared on the banks of the jordan in the form of perfect manhood but it was a form only and not a substance a human figure created by the hand of omnipotence to imitate the faculties and actions of a man and to impose a perpetual illusion on the senses of his friends and enemies	1673
dev-clean/1673/143396/1673-143396-0010.flac	but the rashness of these concessions has encouraged a milder sentiment of those of the docetes who taught not that christ was a phantom but that he was clothed with an impassible and incorruptible body	1673

dev-clean/1673/143396/1673-143396-0013.flac	when the messiah was delivered into the hands of the jews the christ an immortal and impassible being forsook his earthly tabernacle flew back to the pleroma or world of spirits and left the solitary jesus to suffer to complain and to expire	1673
dev-clean/1673/143396/1673-143396-0014.flac	but the justice and generosity of such a desertion are strongly questionable and the fate of an innocent martyr at first impelled and at length abandoned by his divine companion might provoke the pity and indignation of the profane	1673
dev-clean/1673/143396/1673-143396-0015.flac	their murmurs were variously silenced by the sectaries who espoused and modified the double system of cerinthus	1673

dev-clean/1673/143396/1673-143396-0018.flac	he acquiesced in the old distinction of the greek philosophers between the rational and sensitive soul of man that he might reserve the logos for intellectual functions and employ the subordinate human principle in the meaner actions of animal life	1673
dev-clean/1673/143396/1673-143396-0019.flac	but instead of a temporary and occasional alliance they established and we still embrace the substantial indissoluble and everlasting union of a perfect god with a perfect man of the second person of the trinity with a reasonable soul and human flesh	1673

dev-clean/1673/143397/1673-143397-0002.flac	such crimes would have deserved the animadversion of the magistrate but in this promiscuous outrage the innocent were confounded with the guilty and alexandria was impoverished by the loss of a wealthy and industrious colony	1673
dev-clean/1673/143397/1673-143397-0003.flac	the zeal of cyril exposed him to the penalties of the julian law but in a feeble government and a superstitious age he was secure of impunity and even of praise	1673

dev-clean/1993/147149/1993-147149-0007.flac	over the child which yet breathed the father bent watching anxiously for some ground of hope where hope there was none	1993

dev-clean/1993/147149/1993-147149-0018.flac	he did not speak as though fearing to destroy by sound or motion the happiness of that moment when her soft hands touch thrilled through his frame and her silvery voice was whispering tenderness in his ear	1993

dev-clean/1993/147149/1993-147149-0022.flac	so leaving kind messages to george and jane wilson and hesitating whether she might dare to send a few kind words to jem and deciding that she had better not she stepped out into the bright morning light so fresh a contrast to the darkened room where death had been	1993
dev-clean/1993/147149/1993-147149-0023.flac	her thoughts ran on jems manner and words not but what she had known the tale they told for many a day but still she wished he had not put it so plainly	1993
dev-clean/1993/147149/1993-147149-0024.flac	i cannot think what possesses me that i must always be wanting to comfort him when hes downcast and that i must go meddling wi him to night when sure enough it was his aunts place to speak to him	1993

dev-clean/1993/147149/1993-147149-0027.flac	there was something of keen practical shrewdness about her which contrasted very bewitchingly with the simple foolish unworldly ideas she had picked up from the romances which miss simmonds young ladies were in the habit of recommending to each other yes	1993
dev-clean/1993/147149/1993-147149-0028.flac	the old leaven infused years ago by her aunt esther fermented in her little bosom and perhaps all the more for her fathers aversion to the rich and the gentle	1993
dev-clean/1993/147149/1993-147149-0029.flac	it was a comfort to her when scolded by miss simmonds to think of the day when she would drive up to the door in her own carriage to order her gowns from the hasty tempered yet kind dressmaker	1993
dev-clean/1993/147149/1993-147149-0030.flac	but the best of her plans the holiest that which in some measure redeemed the vanity of the rest were those relating to her father her dear father now oppressed with care and always a disheartened gloomy person	1993

dev-clean/1993/147964/1993-147964-0010.flac	i can see them now exactly as they looked working about the table in the lamplight jake with his heavy features so rudely moulded that his face seemed somehow unfinished otto with his half ear and the savage scar that made his upper lip curl so ferociously under his twisted mustache	1993
dev-clean/1993/147965/1993-147965-0000.flac	grandfather came down wearing a white shirt and his sunday coat	1993

dev-clean/1993/147965/1993-147965-0003.flac	because he talked so little his words had a peculiar force they were not worn dull from constant use	1993

dev-clean/1993/147965/1993-147965-0007.flac	his face had a look of weariness and pleasure like that of sick people when they feel relief from pain	1993
dev-clean/1993/147965/1993-147965-0008.flac	he made the sign of the cross over me put on his cap and went off in the dark	1993
dev-clean/1993/147966/1993-147966-0000.flac	the week following christmas brought in a thaw and by new years day all the world about us was a broth of gray slush and the guttered slope between the windmill and the barn was running black water	1993
dev-clean/1993/147966/1993-147966-0001.flac	it was the first time missus shimerda had been to our house and she ran about examining our carpets and curtains and furniture all the while commenting upon them to her daughter in an envious complaining tone	1993

dev-clean/2035/147960/2035-147960-0001.flac	this change came about from an adventure we had together	2035
dev-clean/2035/147960/2035-147960-0002.flac	one day when i rode over to the shimerdas i found antonia starting off on foot for russian peters house to borrow a spade ambrosch needed	2035

dev-clean/2086/149220/2086-149220-0033.flac	well i dont wish to see it any more observed phoebe turning away her eyes it is certainly very like the old portrait	2086
dev-clean/2086/149220/2086-149220-0034.flac	if the original is still in the world i think he might defy the sun to make him look stern and hard	2086
dev-clean/2086/149220/2086-149220-0035.flac	is there nothing wild in the eye continued holgrave so earnestly that it embarrassed phoebe as did also the quiet freedom with which he presumed on their so recent acquaintance	2086
dev-clean/2086/149220/2086-149220-0036.flac	it is nonsense said phoebe a little impatiently for us to talk about a picture which you have never seen	2086
dev-clean/2086/149220/2086-149220-0037.flac	since you are a friend of my cousin hepzibahs you should ask her to show you the picture	2086

dev-clean/2086/149220/2086-149220-0040.flac	oh rejoined the daguerreotypist because like an old ladys cup of tea it is water bewitched	2086
dev-clean/2086/149220/2086-149220-0041.flac	she was indistinctly aware however that the gaunt figure of the old gentlewoman was sitting in one of the straight backed chairs a little withdrawn from the window the faint gleam of which showed the blanched paleness of her cheek turned sideways towards a corner	2086
dev-clean/2086/149220/2086-149220-0042.flac	but put it on the table in the corner of the passage	2086

dev-clean/2086/149220/2086-149220-0044.flac	how wonderfully responsive to every emotion of the human soul	2086
dev-clean/2086/149220/2086-149220-0045.flac	fewer words than before but with the same mysterious music in them	2086

dev-clean/2086/149220/2086-149220-0047.flac	i will sit in the parlor awhile and collect my thoughts	2086
dev-clean/2086/149220/2086-149220-0048.flac	while thus dismissing her the maiden lady stept forward kissed phoebe and pressed her to her heart which beat against the girls bosom with a strong high and tumultuous swell	2086
dev-clean/2086/149220/2086-149220-0049.flac	at some uncertain period in the depths of night and as it were through the thin veil of a dream she was conscious of a footstep mounting the stairs heavily but not with force and decision	2086
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0000.flac	minnies flat as the one floor resident apartments were then being called was in a part of west van buren street inhabited by families of labourers and clerks men who had come and were still coming with the rush of population pouring in at the rate of fifty thousand a year	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0001.flac	to carrie the sound of the little bells upon the horse cars as they tinkled in and out of hearing was as pleasing as it was novel	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0002.flac	to him the presence or absence of his wifes sister was a matter of indifference	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0003.flac	he was of a clean saving disposition and had already paid a number of monthly instalments on two lots far out on the west side	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0004.flac	his ambition was some day to build a house on them	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0005.flac	she had some slight gift of observation and that sense so rich in every woman intuition	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0006.flac	the walls of the rooms were discordantly papered	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0007.flac	the floors were covered with matting and the hall laid with a thin rag carpet	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0008.flac	then she walked and sang to it until hanson disturbed in his reading came and took it	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0009.flac	one could see that he was very much wrapped up in his offspring	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0010.flac	now now he said walking there there and there was a certain swedish accent noticeable in his voice	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0011.flac	he seemed to be thinking of something else	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0012.flac	minnie began to explain but her husband took this part of the conversation to himself	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0013.flac	you could get home easy too it isnt very far	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0014.flac	she asked minnie for ink and paper which were upon the mantel in the dining room and when the latter had gone to bed at ten got out drouets card and wrote him	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0015.flac	she wanted to make some reference to their relations upon the train but was too timid	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0016.flac	anything was good enough so long as it paid say five dollars a week to begin with	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0017.flac	a shop girl was the destiny prefigured for the newcomer	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0018.flac	it was under such auspicious circumstances that she started out this morning to look for work	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0019.flac	narrow board walks extended out passing here a house and there a store at far intervals eventually ending on the open prairie	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0020.flac	it gave an imposing appearance to most of the wholesale houses whose offices were upon the ground floor and in plain view of the street	2277
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277-149874-0021.flac	these vast buildings what were they	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0000.flac	he was in a fevered state of mind owing to the blight his wifes action threatened to cast upon his entire future	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0001.flac	he would have to pay her the money which she would now regularly demand or there would be trouble it did not matter what he did	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0002.flac	hurstwood walked the floor mentally arranging the chief points of his situation	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0003.flac	he also thought of his managerial position	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0004.flac	how would the papers talk about it	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0005.flac	many little wrinkles gathered between his eyes as he contemplated this and his brow moistened	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0006.flac	he could arrange that satisfactorily for carrie would be glad to wait if necessary	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0007.flac	he would see how things turned out to morrow and then he would talk to her they were going to meet as usual	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0008.flac	for some reason he felt as if something might come that way and was relieved when all the envelopes had been scanned and nothing suspicious noticed	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0009.flac	while the danger had not lessened it had not as yet materialised and with him no news was good news	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0010.flac	so little did he consider drouet that it never once occurred to him to worry about his finding out	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0011.flac	he grew restless as he ruminated and then decided that perhaps it was nothing	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0012.flac	she had not been able to get away this morning	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0013.flac	he would get one to day it would probably be on his desk when he got back he would look for it at once	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0014.flac	after a time he gave up waiting and drearily headed for the madison car	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0015.flac	he went in and examined his letters but there was nothing from carrie	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0016.flac	fortunately there was nothing from his wife either	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0017.flac	at one thirty he went to rectors for lunch and when he returned a messenger was waiting for him	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0018.flac	his first impulse was to write but four words in reply go to the devil	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0019.flac	but he compromised by telling the boy that there would be no reply	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0020.flac	then he sat down in his chair and gazed without seeing contemplating the result of his work	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0021.flac	what would she do about that the confounded wretch	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0022.flac	later however his old discretion asserted itself	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0023.flac	something had to be done a climax was near and she would not sit idle	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0024.flac	he knew her well enough to know that when she had decided upon a plan she would follow it up	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0025.flac	he arose from his chair and went and looked out into the street	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0026.flac	the long drizzle had begun pedestrians had turned up collars and trousers at the bottom	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0027.flac	hurstwood almost exclaimed out loud at the insistency of this thing	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0028.flac	he put on his hat and looked around for his umbrella	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0029.flac	he would have some arrangement of this thing	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0030.flac	he began to wish that he had compromised in some way or other that he had sent the money perhaps he could do it up here	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0031.flac	he would go in and see anyhow he would have no row	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0032.flac	by the time he reached his own street he was keenly alive to the difficulties of his situation and wished over and over that some solution would offer itself that he could see his way out	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0033.flac	then he rang the bell no answer	2277
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277-149896-0034.flac	he rang again this time harder still no answer	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0000.flac	when hurstwood got back to his office again he was in a greater quandary than ever	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0001.flac	he could hardly realise how it had all come about	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0002.flac	no letter had come no word of any kind and yet here it was late in the evening and she had agreed to meet him that morning	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0003.flac	he saw that in the excitement of recent events he had not formulated a plan upon that score	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0004.flac	he was getting some vague comfort out of a good cigar but it was no panacea for the ill which affected him	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0005.flac	it was with great opposition after two or three hours of the most urgent mental affirmation and denial that at last he got an envelope placed in it the requested amount and slowly sealed it up	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0006.flac	then he called harry the boy of all work around the place	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0007.flac	you take this to this address he said handing him the envelope and give it to missus hurstwood yes sir said the boy	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0008.flac	any answer i guess not	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0009.flac	the boy hastened away and the manager fell to his musings	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0010.flac	he was beaten for to night and he might just as well make the best of it	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0011.flac	she would take the envelope and know that she had triumphed	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0012.flac	if he only had that letter back he wouldnt send it	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0013.flac	for relief he arose and joined in conversation with a few friends who were drinking	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0014.flac	all the time his thoughts would run out to his home and see the scene being therein enacted	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0015.flac	in about an hour and three quarters the boy returned	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0016.flac	he fancied as he sat at his desk that nothing would be done for a week or two meanwhile he would have time to think	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0017.flac	how about that now his pain at her failure to meet or write him rapidly increased as he devoted himself to this subject	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0018.flac	he decided to write her care of the west side post office and ask for an explanation as well as to have her meet him	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0019.flac	three oclock came four five six and no letter	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0020.flac	the helpless manager paced the floor and grimly endured the gloom of defeat	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0021.flac	he saw a busy saturday ushered out the sabbath in and nothing done	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0022.flac	all day the bar being closed he brooded alone shut out from home from the excitement of his resort from carrie and without the ability to alter his condition one iota	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0023.flac	it was the worst sunday he had spent in his life	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0024.flac	it seemed as if his family troubles were just beginning	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0025.flac	he was quite certain now that she knew he was married and was angered at his perfidy	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0026.flac	he had loved her earnestly enough but now that the possibility of losing her stared him in the face she seemed much more attractive	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0027.flac	he would go to her and tell her all his family complications	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0028.flac	he would explain to her just where he stood and how much he needed her	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0029.flac	he did manage to bring himself into the mood to go out to carrie but when he got in ogden place he thought he saw a man watching him and went away	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0030.flac	he did not go within a block of the house	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0031.flac	he troubled over many little details and talked perfunctorily to everybody	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0032.flac	he stayed at his desk long after all others had gone and only quitted it when the night watchman on his round pulled at the front door to see if it was safely locked	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0033.flac	on wednesday he received another polite note from mc gregor james and hay it read	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0034.flac	dear sir we beg to inform you that we are instructed to wait until to morrow thursday at one oclock before filing suit against you on behalf of missus julia hurstwood for divorce and alimony	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0035.flac	very truly yours et cetera compromise	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0036.flac	so here it was spread out clear before him and now he knew what to expect	2277
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277-149897-0037.flac	if he didnt go and see them they would sue him promptly	2277
dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0000.flac	preface to second edition	2412
dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0001.flac	this is a mistake though a perfectly natural one	2412
dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0002.flac	on my return i purposely avoided looking into it until i had sent back my last revises to the printer	2412
dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0003.flac	then i had much pleasure in reading it but was indeed surprised at the many little points of similarity between the two books in spite of their entire independence to one another	2412
dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0004.flac	i regret that reviewers have in some cases been inclined to treat the chapters on machines as an attempt to reduce mister darwins theory to an absurdity	2412
dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0005.flac	i am surprised however that the book at which such an example of the specious misuse of analogy would seem most naturally levelled should have occurred to no reviewer neither shall i mention the name of the book here though i should fancy that the hint given will suffice	2412
dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0006.flac	but this had an effect of which i have little reason to complain for i was allowed almost to call them life long self deceivers to their faces and they said it was quite true but that it did not matter	2412
dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0007.flac	i must not conclude without expressing my most sincere thanks to my critics and to the public for the leniency and consideration with which they have treated my adventures	2412
dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0008.flac	it was written in the upper rangitata district of the canterbury province as it then was of new zealand and appeared at christchurch in the press newspaper june thirteenth eighteen sixty three	2412
dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0009.flac	i also wrote about this time the substance of what ultimately became the musical banks and the trial of a man for being in a consumption	2412
dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0010.flac	i see from my second preface that i took the book to messrs chapman and hall may first eighteen seventy one and on their rejection of it under the advice of one who has attained the highest rank among living writers i let it sleep till i took it to mister trubner early in eighteen seventy two	2412
dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0011.flac	i attribute its unlooked for success mainly to two early favourable reviews the first in the pall mall gazette of april twelfth and the second in the spectator of april twentieth	2412
dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0012.flac	there was also another cause	2412
dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0013.flac	the first edition of erewhon sold in about three weeks i had not taken moulds and as the demand was strong it was set up again immediately	2412
dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0014.flac	i made a few further very trifling alterations before moulds were taken but since the summer of eighteen seventy two as new editions were from time to time wanted they have been printed from stereos then made	2412
dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0015.flac	i am still fairly well satisfied with those parts of erewhon that were repeatedly rewritten but from those that had only a single writing i would gladly cut out some forty or fifty pages if i could	2412
dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0016.flac	this however may not be for the copyright will probably expire in a little over twelve years	2412
dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0000.flac	if the reader will excuse me i will say nothing of my antecedents nor of the circumstances which led me to leave my native country the narrative would be tedious to him and painful to myself	2412
dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0001.flac	it will be seen that i did not succeed in my design and that however much i may have met with that was new and strange i have been unable to reap any pecuniary advantage	2412
dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0002.flac	no one who is himself honest will doubt my being so	2412
dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0003.flac	i reached my destination in one of the last months of eighteen sixty eight but i dare not mention the season lest the reader should gather in which hemisphere i was	2412
dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0004.flac	sheep and cattle were introduced and bred with extreme rapidity men took up their fifty thousand or one hundred thousand acres of country going inland one behind the other till in a few years there was not an acre between the sea and the front ranges which was not taken up and stations either for sheep or cattle were spotted about at intervals of some twenty or thirty miles over the whole country	2412
dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0005.flac	i was delighted with the country and the manner of life	2412
dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0006.flac	i was to see the sheep not necessarily close at hand nor to get them in a single mob but to see enough of them here and there to feel easy that nothing had gone wrong this was no difficult matter for there were not above eight hundred of them and being all breeding ewes they were pretty quiet	2412
dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0007.flac	there were a good many sheep which i knew as two or three black ewes and a black lamb or two and several others which had some distinguishing mark whereby i could tell them	2412
dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0008.flac	it is surprising how soon the eye becomes accustomed to missing twenty sheep out of two or three hundred	2412
dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0009.flac	it was a monotonous life but it was very healthy and one does not much mind anything when one is well	2412
dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0010.flac	the country was the grandest that can be imagined	2412
dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0011.flac	so lonely and so solemn with the sad grey clouds above and no sound save a lost lamb bleating upon the mountain side as though its little heart were breaking	2412
dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0012.flac	each must cry louder and wander farther yet may luck be with them both that they may find their own at nightfall	2412
dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0013.flac	i had no money but if i could only find workable country i might stock it with borrowed capital and consider myself a made man	2412
dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0014.flac	there was no one in the whole world who had the smallest idea save those who were themselves on the other side of it if indeed there was any one at all could i hope to cross it	2412
dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0015.flac	i would try the nearer range and see how far i could go	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0000.flac	shortly after passing one of these chapels we came suddenly upon a village which started up out of the mist and i was alarmed lest i should be made an object of curiosity or dislike	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0001.flac	my guides however were well known and the natural politeness of the people prevented them from putting me to any inconvenience but they could not help eyeing me nor i them	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0002.flac	the streets were narrow and unpaved but very fairly clean	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0003.flac	the vine grew outside many of the houses and there were some with sign boards on which was painted a bottle and a glass that made me feel much at home	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0004.flac	even on this ledge of human society there was a stunted growth of shoplets which had taken root and vegetated somehow though as in an air mercantile of the bleakest	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0005.flac	each feature was finished eyelids eyelashes and ears being almost invariably perfect	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0006.flac	their expression was divine and as they glanced at me timidly but with parted lips in great bewilderment i forgot all thoughts of their conversion in feelings that were far more earthly	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0007.flac	even in middle age they were still comely and the old grey haired women at their cottage doors had a dignity not to say majesty of their own	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0008.flac	the men were as handsome as the women beautiful	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0009.flac	i have always delighted in and reverenced beauty but i felt simply abashed in the presence of such a splendid type a compound of all that is best in egyptian greek and italian	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0010.flac	the children were infinite in number and exceedingly merry i need hardly say that they came in for their full share of the prevailing beauty	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0011.flac	i expressed by signs my admiration and pleasure to my guides and they were greatly pleased	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0012.flac	the country was highly cultivated every ledge being planted with chestnuts walnuts and apple trees from which the apples were now gathering	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0013.flac	i saw a few sheep with rounded noses and enormous tails	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0014.flac	in about four hours of walking from the time we started and after passing two or three more villages we came upon a considerable town and my guides made many attempts to make me understand something but i gathered no inkling of their meaning except that i need be under no apprehension of danger	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0015.flac	suffice it that i found myself taken before the chief magistrate and by his orders was placed in an apartment with two other people who were the first i had seen looking anything but well and handsome	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0016.flac	in fact one of them was plainly very much out of health and coughed violently from time to time in spite of manifest efforts to suppress it	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0017.flac	the other looked pale and ill but he was marvellously self contained and it was impossible to say what was the matter with him	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0018.flac	they felt my pulse they looked at my tongue they listened at my chest they felt all my muscles and at the end of each operation they looked at the chief and nodded and said something in a tone quite pleasant as though i were all right	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0019.flac	but by and by they came to my watch which i had hidden away in the inmost pocket that i had and had forgotten when they began their search	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0020.flac	again there was a very old carriage whose wheels in spite of rust and decay i could see had been designed originally for iron rails	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0021.flac	we passed many cases and at last came to one in which there were several clocks and two or three old watches	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0022.flac	the design was different but the thing was clearly the same	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0023.flac	this had some effect in calming him	2412
dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0024.flac	he began presently to relent and spoke to me in a kinder manner	2412
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0000.flac	i imagine there were several kinds of old fashioned christmases but it could hardly be worse than a chop in my chambers or horror of horrors at the club or my cousin lucys notion of what she calls the festive season	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0001.flac	festive yes	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0002.flac	the reply was written in a sprawling feminine hand it was a little vague	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0003.flac	it appeared that the terms would be five guineas but there was no mention of the length of time which that fee would cover	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0004.flac	the whole thing was a trifle odd	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0005.flac	there was nothing said about the sort of accommodation which would be provided nothing about the kind of establishment which was maintained or the table which was kept	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0006.flac	now it is a remarkable thing that i have always had an extraordinary predilection for the name madge i do not know why	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0007.flac	i have never known a madge and yet from my boyhood upward i have desired to meet one	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0008.flac	under such circumstances she was hardly likely to be lively herself but her name was madge and it was the accident of her christian name which decided me to go	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0009.flac	i had no illusions	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0010.flac	i did not expect a princely entertainment	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0011.flac	all night it had been blowing and raining	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0012.flac	i felt quite lively myself as i mingled with the christmas crowd looking for things which might not turn out to be absolutely preposterous	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0013.flac	i even bought something for madge i mean missus wilson	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0014.flac	it was a horrible journey	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0015.flac	he was impervious to reason	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0016.flac	it is some satisfaction for me to be able to reflect that i made it warm for the officials however cold i might have been myself	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0017.flac	when at last i reached crofton my journeys end it turned out that the station staff consisted of a half witted individual who was stationmaster porter and clerk combined and a hulking lad who did whatever else there was to do	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0018.flac	no one had come to meet me the village was about half a mile and hangar dene the house for which my steps were bent about four miles by the road how far it was across ploughed fields my informant did not mention	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0019.flac	there was a trap at the boy and blunderbuss but that required fetching	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0020.flac	when the trap did appear it looked to me uncommonly like an open spring cart	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0021.flac	in it i was deposited with my luggage	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0022.flac	i did not know what he meant	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0023.flac	i did not ask i was beyond it	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0024.flac	i was chilled to the bone wet tired hungry	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0025.flac	i had long been wishing that an old fashioned christmas had been completely extinct before i had thought of adventuring in quest of one	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0026.flac	here we be that might be so	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0027.flac	there be the door in front of you you go up three steps if you can find em	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0028.flac	theres a knocker if none of em havent twisted it off	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0029.flac	there appeared to be no knocker though whether it had been twisted off was more than i could say	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0030.flac	no answer though i allowed a more than decent interval	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0031.flac	better ring again suggested the driver hard	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0032.flac	maybe theyre up to some of their games and wants rousing	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0033.flac	the bell reverberated through what seemed like an empty house	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0034.flac	presently feet were heard advancing along the passage several pairs it seemed and a light gleamed through the window over the door	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0035.flac	a voice inquired whos there	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0036.flac	the information was greeted with what sounded uncommonly like a chorus of laughter	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0037.flac	there was a rush of retreating feet an expostulating voice then darkness again and silence	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0038.flac	who lives here are the people mad	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0039.flac	i tolled the bell again	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0040.flac	after a vast amount of unfastening the door was opened and on the threshold there stood a girl with a lighted candle in her hand	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0041.flac	im mister christopher from london	2428
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428-83699-0042.flac	weve lost the key of the cellar and theres nothing out except water and i dont think youd care for that	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0000.flac	her father is a most remarkable person to say the least	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0001.flac	but it is quite plain to me that all the arrangements for my wedding are going to be made by the snellings	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0002.flac	i do not know when it is going to be but it will be either next week or the week after certainly at the earliest possible moment and i shouldnt be at all surprised to learn that all mary anns things had been already bought and perhaps some of them marked	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0003.flac	it is most delightful	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0004.flac	it might just as well be some one elses wedding so unimportant is the part which i am set to play in it	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0005.flac	for instance look at their behaviour in the matter of the ring	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0006.flac	the accident in question occurred upon the sunday evening	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0007.flac	the girl is fretting but you dont seem to notice it	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0008.flac	i gasped positively gasped	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0009.flac	thats it on your account	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0010.flac	from a cousin of ours whos in that line	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0011.flac	i never saw people like the snellings for possessing relatives in all sorts of lines	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0012.flac	i was persuaded that somebody besides that cousin got a profit out of mary anns engagement ring but i handed over the amount	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0013.flac	it is from her action in that matter that my suspicion springs	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0014.flac	there she owns a cottage or it may be a pigstye for all i know	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0015.flac	when she heard of my engagement with mary ann she wrote and suggested that we should spend our honeymoon in her cottage or pigstye and that i should pay her rent for it	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0016.flac	there were no signs of faltering about her flow of language	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0017.flac	i found that as a woman of business she was beyond all my expectations	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0018.flac	it turned out that she had a little money of her own about a hundred and thirty pounds a year	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0019.flac	and of course i had my expectations and she had hers	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0020.flac	it was plain that together we should manage most comfortably delightfully in fact	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0021.flac	i shall make papa give me five hundred pounds at least	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0022.flac	a bird in the hand is worth two in a bush and it will be something to have by us	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0023.flac	i know what mamma can afford to give and i will see she gives it	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0024.flac	and i will see that there is no shirking about the boys or about the girls either	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0025.flac	i have drawn up a list of all the people who ought to give us a present and i shall tell them what they ought to give it wont be my fault if i dont get it	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0026.flac	of course there are some people with whom you cant be perfectly plain but i shall be as plain as i can theres a way and a manner of doing that kind of thing	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0027.flac	hers has been prodigious	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0028.flac	she has a knack of getting people to do what she wishes and to give her what she wants which is a little short of miraculous	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0029.flac	i notice that they are generally persons who have already tendered their offerings	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0030.flac	the fact of having given mary ann a wedding present seems to fill them with a feeling of rancorous acidity which to me is inexplicable	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0031.flac	such is the selfishness of human nature	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0032.flac	but why on that account they should pity me i altogether fail to understand	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0033.flac	we have all been giving mary ann presents and i suppose you mister whiting have been giving her something too	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0034.flac	that was what missus macpherson said to me only the other day	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0035.flac	and what inquired missus macpherson has mary ann given you her love	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0036.flac	someone sniggered	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0037.flac	i cannot pretend to explain why except on the supposition that romance is dead at least in that circle of society in which the snellings move	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0038.flac	as it is unless i am mistaken some of the rending will be on our side and they know it	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0039.flac	p s the cards are out for the wedding	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0040.flac	we are going for our honeymoon to italy and the south of france	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0041.flac	a second cousin of mary anns is in the cooks tours line	2428
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428-83705-0042.flac	he has given us free passes all the way to the end of our journey and all the way back again and coupons for free board and lodging at the hotel its a wedding present	2428

dev-clean/251/137823/251-137823-0016.flac	and the only truck we had available was in that burning shed the superintendent added bitterly	251
dev-clean/251/137823/251-137823-0017.flac	anyhow we want to help got a job for us	251
dev-clean/251/137823/251-137823-0018.flac	within minutes tom was in charge of clearing away rubble and extricating anyone who might be trapped inside the buildings	251
dev-clean/251/137823/251-137823-0019.flac	the telephone line was soon repaired and a steady stream of rescue vehicles began arriving from harkness fire trucks three ambulances and private cars driven by volunteers	251
dev-clean/251/137823/251-137823-0020.flac	the two girls were as much upset as toms mother tom laughed	251
dev-clean/251/137823/251-137823-0021.flac	mister swift came into the living room just then and told tom how worried missus swift and sandy had been	251

dev-clean/2803/154320/2803-154320-0006.flac	what then my lord	2803
dev-clean/2803/154320/2803-154320-0007.flac	god keep us from such a meeting why john	2803

dev-clean/2803/154320/2803-154320-0010.flac	we would fight to the death of course but after that	2803
dev-clean/2803/154320/2803-154320-0011.flac	think of lady glenarvan think of mary grant	2803
dev-clean/2803/154320/2803-154320-0012.flac	will halley is a brute but i am keeping my eyes open and if the coast looks dangerous i will put the ships head to sea again	2803
dev-clean/2803/154320/2803-154320-0013.flac	so that on that score there is little or no danger	2803

dev-clean/2803/154328/2803-154328-0014.flac	animal or man answered the major i will soon find out	2803
dev-clean/2803/154328/2803-154328-0015.flac	wilson and olbinett joined their companions and all united to dig through the wall john with his dagger the others with stones taken from the ground or with their nails while mulrady stretched along the ground watched the native guard through a crevice of the matting	2803
dev-clean/2803/154328/2803-154328-0016.flac	what could be the object	2803
dev-clean/2803/154328/2803-154328-0017.flac	did they know of the existence of the prisoners or was it some private enterprise that led to the undertaking	2803
dev-clean/2803/154328/2803-154328-0018.flac	their fingers bled but still they worked on after half an hour they had gone three feet deep they perceived by the increased sharpness of the sounds that only a thin layer of earth prevented immediate communication	2803
dev-clean/2803/154328/2803-154328-0019.flac	john mangles inserting the blade of his poniard avoided the knife which now protruded above the soil but seized the hand that wielded it	2803
dev-clean/2803/154328/2803-154328-0020.flac	but softly as the name was breathed mary grant already awakened by the sounds in the hut slipped over toward glenarvan and seizing the hand all stained with earth she covered it with kisses	2803
dev-clean/2803/154328/2803-154328-0021.flac	watch the savages outside said robert	2803
dev-clean/2803/154328/2803-154328-0022.flac	round his body was rolled a long coil of flax rope	2803
dev-clean/2803/154328/2803-154328-0023.flac	my child my child murmured lady helena the savages did not kill you	2803
dev-clean/2803/161169/2803-161169-0000.flac	once there was a father who thought he would build for his children a beautiful home putting into it every thing they could need or desire throughout their lives	2803
dev-clean/2803/161169/2803-161169-0001.flac	the sweetest perfumes floated through the air while thousands of birds answered the music of fountains with their songs	2803
dev-clean/2803/161169/2803-161169-0002.flac	why did he give that so odd a shape or so strange a covering	2803
dev-clean/2803/161169/2803-161169-0003.flac	and so through many questions and many experiments they learn at last how to use the contents of this one storehouse	2803
dev-clean/2803/161169/2803-161169-0004.flac	the entrance is light because it opens so wide but we can see that the floor slopes downward and the way looks dark and narrow before us	2803
dev-clean/2803/161169/2803-161169-0005.flac	walk down the sloping foot path now and be careful to keep out of the way of the little cars that are coming and going on each side of you loaded on one side and empty on the other and seeming to run up and down by themselves	2803
dev-clean/2803/161169/2803-161169-0006.flac	look a little closer while our guide lets the light of his lamp fall upon the black wall at your side	2803
dev-clean/2803/161169/2803-161169-0007.flac	see beneath your feet is the marking of great tree trunks lying aslant across the floor and the forms of gigantic palm leaves strewed among them	2803
dev-clean/2803/161169/2803-161169-0008.flac	here is something different rounded like a nut shell you can split off one side and behold there is the nut lying snugly as does any chestnut in its bur	2803
dev-clean/2803/161169/2803-161169-0009.flac	ferns and palms mosses and trees and animals all perfect all beautiful and yet all hidden away under this hill and turned into shining black coal now i can very well remember when i first saw a coal fire and how odd it looked to see what seemed to be burning stones	2803
dev-clean/2803/161169/2803-161169-0010.flac	for when i was a little girl we always had logs of wood blazing in an open fireplace and so did many other people and coal was just coming into use for fuel	2803
dev-clean/2803/161169/2803-161169-0011.flac	what should we have done if everybody had kept on burning wood to this day	2803
dev-clean/2803/161169/2803-161169-0012.flac	these forests were of trees different in some ways from those we have now great ferns as tall as this house and mosses as high as little trees and palm leaves of enormous size	2803
dev-clean/2803/161169/2803-161169-0013.flac	then the hills were piled up on top of it all but here and there some edge of a coal bed was tilted up and appeared above the ground	2803
dev-clean/2803/161169/2803-161169-0014.flac	but by and by the wise men thought about it and said to themselves we must find out what useful purpose god made the gas for we know that he does not make any thing for harm only	2803
dev-clean/2803/161169/2803-161169-0015.flac	it was only a trouble to the gas makers who had no use for it and even threw it away until some one more thoughtful than the others found out that water would not pass through it	2803
dev-clean/2803/161169/2803-161169-0016.flac	dont you see how many uses we have found for this refuse coal tar	2803
dev-clean/2803/161169/2803-161169-0017.flac	when your hands or lips are cracked and rough from the cold does your mother ever put on glycerin to heal them	2803
dev-clean/2902/9006/2902-9006-0000.flac	one who writes of such an era labours under a troublesome disadvantage	2902

dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0037.flac	the old mans eyes shot fire and unconsciously one foot slipped to the floor	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0038.flac	she had no companion near her	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0039.flac	no word no cry just a collapse and sudden fall	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0040.flac	in olden days they would have said struck by a bolt from heaven	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0041.flac	what do you make of it gryce	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0042.flac	i should like to see the desk you speak of and the spot where she fell	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0043.flac	a young fellow who had been hovering in the background at once stepped forward	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0044.flac	he was the plain faced detective who had spoken to george	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0045.flac	this sweetwater as they called him was i have since understood one of his proteges and more or less of a favourite	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0046.flac	been over the ground studied the affair carefully	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0047.flac	very well then youre in a position to pioneer me	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0048.flac	well well thats honest at all events	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0049.flac	but im in no position to make promises	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0050.flac	old days dont return for the asking	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0051.flac	whether he got anything else it would be impossible to say from his manner as he finally sank into a chair by one of the openings and looked down on the lobby below	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0052.flac	one or two of the musicians from the end of the hall	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0053.flac	naturally they reached her first	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0054.flac	mark sowerby and claus hennerberg	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0055.flac	honest germans men who have played here for years	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0056.flac	who came next on the scene some people from the lobby	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0057.flac	anybody before the father came in	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0058.flac	yes miss clarke the middle aged lady with the parrishes	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0059.flac	i suppose she has been carefully questioned very i should say	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0060.flac	and she speaks of no weapon	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0061.flac	not till the doctor came her doctor who was happily in his office in this very building	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0062.flac	yes mister slater the assistant manager who was in the lobby at the time says that ten minutes at least must have elapsed	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0063.flac	no doubt	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0064.flac	sweetwater someone drew that weapon out	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0065.flac	not altogether by me	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0066.flac	wherever she pleases only i cant walk far	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0067.flac	it has not been running since last night or it would be full of curious people all the time hustling to get a glimpse of this place	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0068.flac	but theyll put a man on for you	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0069.flac	very good manage it as you will	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0070.flac	ill wait here till youre ready explain yourself to the lady tell her im an old and rheumatic invalid who has been used to asking his own questions	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0071.flac	as her quiet figure appeared in the doorway sweetwater stole a glance at mister gryce	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0072.flac	there was no doubting them in this instance	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0073.flac	yes	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0074.flac	for some little time that is it seemed long though i believe it was not more than a minute before two men came running from the musicians gallery	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0075.flac	yes many times	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0076.flac	what made the difference	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0077.flac	miss clarke started and her sweet face showed a moments perplexity did i she queried musingly	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0078.flac	no a very natural one i should say	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0079.flac	and the glance she cast him while not meeting his eye showed that she understood the importance of the admission	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0080.flac	i know she said what you are going to ask me now	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0081.flac	there was no poniard in the wound	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0082.flac	the time is narrowed down to one and in that one miss clarke was the only person to touch her	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0083.flac	i will trouble you no further	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0084.flac	sweetwater help me out of this	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0085.flac	but vigour returned to him before he had well reached the door and he showed some of his old spirit as he thanked miss clarke and turned to take the elevator	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0086.flac	the next minute she was in this ladys arms	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0087.flac	no weapon protruded from the wound nor was any found on or near her in the mezzanine what follows	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0088.flac	she struck the blow herself and the strength of purpose which led her to do this gave her the additional force to pull the weapon out and fling it from her	3081
dev-clean/3081/166546/3081-166546-0089.flac	it did not fall upon the floor around her therefore it flew through one of those openings into the lobby and there it either will be or has been found	3081
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0000.flac	with an education which ought to have ensured me an honourable standing in the world with some intelligence wit good literary and scientific knowledge and endowed with those accidental physical qualities which are such a good passport into society i found myself at the age of twenty the mean follower of a sublime art in which if great talent is rightly admired mediocrity is as rightly despised	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0001.flac	i was compelled by poverty to become a member of a musical band in which i could expect neither esteem nor consideration and i was well aware that i should be the laughing stock of the persons who had known me as a doctor in divinity as an ecclesiastic and as an officer in the army and had welcomed me in the highest society	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0002.flac	i felt that in my first profession as i was not blessed with the vocation necessary to it i should have succeeded only by dint of hypocrisy and i should have been despicable in my own estimation even if i had seen the purple mantle on my shoulders for the greatest dignities cannot silence a mans own conscience	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0003.flac	besides i was of opinion that a mans profession whatever it might be ought to supply him with enough money to satisfy all his wants and the very poor pay of an officer would never have been sufficient to cover my expenses because my education had given me greater wants than those of officers in general	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0004.flac	our scandalous proceedings often exposed us to the greatest danger	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0005.flac	we would very often spend the whole night rambling about the city inventing and carrying into execution the most impertinent practical jokes	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0006.flac	we did the same with physicians whom we often sent half dressed to some nobleman who was enjoying excellent health	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0007.flac	whenever we could contrive to get into a church tower we thought it great fun to frighten all the parish by ringing the alarm bell as if some fire had broken out but that was not all we always cut the bell ropes so that in the morning the churchwardens had no means of summoning the faithful to early mass	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0008.flac	this is the amusing adventure which closed our exploits	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0009.flac	in every one of the seventy two parishes of the city of venice there is a large public house called magazzino	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0010.flac	yet there are a few private rooms which contain a table surrounded with benches in which a respectable family or a few friends can enjoy themselves in a decent way	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0011.flac	the waiter of the magazzino came to be paid and our chief gave him what was due enjoining silence under penalty of death	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0012.flac	we took our three prisoners to a large boat	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0013.flac	where is my husband	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0014.flac	never fear you shall see him again to morrow	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0015.flac	my readers may imagine whether we felt inclined to laugh when the charming creature bade us good night thanking us all with perfect good faith	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0016.flac	two days afterwards our nocturnal orgy began to be talked of	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0017.flac	it went on to say that the two men who had carried her off had taken her to such a place where they had an hour later been met by the other six and that they had all repaired to the two swords where they had spent an hour in drinking	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0018.flac	there was no cowardly traitor amongst us although we were all poor but fear had its effect and our nocturnal pranks were not renewed	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0019.flac	i picked it up and coming up to him just as he was going down the steps i handed it to him	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0020.flac	i told him and he insisted upon my coming with him in the gondola saying that he would leave me at my house	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0021.flac	i rubbed it with all my strength but he told me in a sort of indistinct whisper that the numbness was spreading all along the left side and that he was dying	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0022.flac	i jumped out of the gondola and found myself on the very spot where three years before i had taught razetta such a forcible lesson i enquired for a surgeon at the first coffee house and ran to the house that was pointed out to me	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0023.flac	taking everything upon myself i ordered a servant to hurry out for a physician who came in a short time and ordered the patient to be bled again thus approving the first bleeding prescribed by me	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0024.flac	thinking i had a right to watch the sick man i settled myself near his bed to give him every care he required	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0025.flac	they did not know who i was and did not like to ask me whilst i thought it better to preserve a modest silence	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0026.flac	he had gambled and lost a great deal and his brother was his most bitter enemy because he was infatuated with the idea that he had tried to poison him	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0027.flac	the physician who attended him was named terro he thought by some peculiar train of reasoning that he could cure him by applying a mercurial ointment to the chest to which no one raised any objection	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0028.flac	delighted with such a fortunate result we lay down again	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0029.flac	he entreated me to tell him the truth	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0030.flac	what extraordinary things will sometimes occur from mere chance or from the force of circumstances	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0031.flac	unwilling to hurt his vanity by telling him that he was mistaken i took the wild resolution of informing him in the presence of his two friends that i possessed a certain numeral calculus which gave answers also in numbers to any questions i liked to put	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0032.flac	i obeyed implicitly and met your excellency	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0033.flac	the three friends were astounded	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0034.flac	i declared myself quite willing for it was necessary to brazen it out after having ventured as far as i had done	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0035.flac	he wrote the question and gave it to me i read it i could not understand either the subject or the meaning of the words but it did not matter i had to give an answer	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0036.flac	if the question was so obscure that i could not make out the sense of it it was natural that i should not understand the answer	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0037.flac	they all asked me how long i would require to teach them the rules of my sublime calculus	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0038.flac	not very long i answered and i will teach you as you wish although the hermit assured me that i would die suddenly within three days if i communicated my science to anyone but i have no faith whatever in that prediction	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0039.flac	they believed that through me they possessed the philosophers stone the universal panacea the intercourse with all the elementary heavenly and infernal spirits they had no doubt whatever that thanks to my sublime science they could find out the secrets of every government in europe	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0040.flac	but although believing fully in my oracles they were too kind hearted to think them the work of the devil and it suited their natural goodness better to believe my answers inspired by some heavenly spirit	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0041.flac	they were not only good christians and faithful to the church but even real devotees and full of scruples	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0042.flac	as for the eucharist transubstantiation the real presence it was all no mystery to them but palpable evidence and yet they were not jesuits	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0043.flac	i might be told that if i had wished to follow the rules of pure morality i ought either to have declined intimate intercourse with them or to have undeceived them	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0044.flac	besides i found it very flattering to my vanity to become the subject of the speculative chattering of empty fools who having nothing else to do are always trying to find out the cause of every moral phenomenon they meet with which their narrow intellect cannot understand	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0045.flac	whoever you may be i am indebted to you for my life	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0046.flac	your apartment is ready you may send your clothes you shall have a servant a gondola at your orders my own table and ten sequins a month	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0047.flac	you need not think of the future think only of enjoying yourself and take me as your adviser in everything that may happen to you in everything you may wish to undertake and you may be certain of always finding me your friend	3170
dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0048.flac	i threw myself at his feet to assure him of my gratitude and embraced him calling him my father	3170
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0000.flac	sir edward not wholly discouraged by the denial with which dorriforth had with delicacy acquainted him still hoped for a kind reception and was so often at the house of missus horton that lord fredericks jealousy was excited and the tortures he suffered in consequence convinced him beyond a doubt of the sincerity of his affection	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0001.flac	every time he beheld the object of his passion for he still continued his visits though not so frequently as heretofore he pleaded his cause with such ardour that miss woodley who was sometimes present and ever compassionate could not resist wishing him success	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0002.flac	yet did the watchful miss woodley oftentimes hear a sigh escape from her unknown to herself till she was reminded of it and then a sudden blush would instantly overspread her face	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0003.flac	night after night his sleep had been disturbed by fears for her when abroad morning after morning it had been broken by the clamour of her return	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0004.flac	i hope miss milner you pass this evening at home	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0005.flac	i thought miss milner you gave me your word that you would pass this evening at home	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0006.flac	yes indeed and i believe it is right that i should keep my first promise is it not	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0007.flac	missus horton rose from her seat moved the decanters and fruit round the table stirred the fire and came back to her seat again before another word was uttered	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0008.flac	nor had this good womans officious labours taken the least from the awkwardness of the silence which as soon as the bustle she had made was over returned in its full force	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0009.flac	miss milner you shall not leave the house this evening sir	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0010.flac	and he walked immediately out of the apartment by another door	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0011.flac	her hand fell motionless from that which she held she appeared motionless herself till missus horton beseeching her not to be uneasy at the treatment she had received made her tears flow as if her heart was breaking	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0012.flac	it was not from any real cause of grief that she wept but there was a magnetic quality in tears which always attracted hers	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0013.flac	do you think i would go answered miss milner with an eagerness that for a time suppressed her tears in contradiction to his will	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0014.flac	if you think so madam i see nothing that should prevent me now	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0015.flac	niece i command you not to stir out of this room this evening	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0016.flac	miss woodley obediently sat down and though her thoughts and heart were in the chamber of her friend she never marked by one impertinent word or by one line of her face the restraint she suffered	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0017.flac	at the usual hour mister dorriforth and his ward were summoned to tea he entered with a countenance which evinced the remains of anger his eye gave testimony of his absent thoughts and though he took up a pamphlet affecting to read it was plain to discern that he scarcely knew he held it in his hand	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0018.flac	miss woodley thought it her duty to be mute and now the gingle of a tea spoon was like a deep toned bell all was so quiet	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0019.flac	missus horton too in the self approving reflection that she was not in a quarrel or altercation of any kind felt herself at this moment remarkably peaceful and charitable	3536

dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0021.flac	he coughed drank his tea endeavoured to talk but found it difficult sometimes read and in this manner near two hours were passed away when miss milner came into the room not dressed for a ball but as she had risen from dinner	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0022.flac	dorriforth read on and seemed afraid of looking up lest he should see what he could not have pardoned	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0023.flac	after a few minutes pause and some little embarrassment on the part of missus horton at the disappointment she had to encounter from this unexpected dutiful conduct she asked miss milner if she would now have any tea	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0024.flac	dorriforth then laid the book out of his hand and by the time the servant had left the room thus began	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0025.flac	it is often the ungrateful task of a friend to be troublesome sometimes unmannerly	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0026.flac	forgive the duties of my office and believe that no one is half so much concerned if it robs you of any degree of happiness as i myself am	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0027.flac	what he said he looked with so much sincerity that had she been burning with rage at his late behaviour she must have forgiven him for the regret which he so forcibly exprest	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0028.flac	she was going to reply but found she could not without accompanying her words with tears therefore after the first attempt she desisted	3536
dev-clean/3536/23268/3536-23268-0029.flac	on this he rose from his chair and going to her said once more shew your submission by obeying me a second time to day	3536

dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0000.flac	in the last communication which he had received from lady milborough she had scolded him in terms that were for her severe because he had not returned to his wife and taken her off with him to naples	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0001.flac	and now it had come to pass that his sole remaining ally mister samuel bozzle the ex policeman was becoming weary of his service	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0002.flac	at last he sent word to say that he himself would be in england before the end of march and would see that the majesty of the law should be vindicated in his favour	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0003.flac	in making this he had expected no success though from the energetic nature of his disposition he had made the attempt with some zeal	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0004.flac	missus bozzle was disposed to think that ladies of quality among whom madame t was entitled in her estimation to take rank were seldom better than they ought to be and she was quite willing that her husband should earn his bread by watching the lady or the ladys lover	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0005.flac	and had the case been brought before the judge ordinary by means of her husbands exertions she would have taken pleasure in reading every word of the evidence even though her husband should have been ever so roughly handled by the lawyers	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0006.flac	a distinct promise of a hundred pounds was made to him if he would have the child ready to hand over to trevelyan on trevelyans arrival in england	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0007.flac	of course it aint said missus bozzle	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0008.flac	the paternal parent has a right to his infants no doubt that was bozzles law	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0009.flac	he cant suckle em can he	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0010.flac	when a married woman has followers and the husband dont go the wrong side of the post too or it aint proved again him that he do theyll never let her have nothing to do with the children	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0011.flac	ill tell you what it is b exclaimed missus bozzle its my belief as he aint quite right up here and missus bozzle touched her forehead	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0012.flac	drat em all what is it they wants they dont know what they wants	3536

dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0014.flac	but as for this here child b	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0015.flac	trevelyan had followed his letter quicker than he had intended when it was written and was now with his prime minister before his prime minister had been able to take any action on the last instruction received	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0016.flac	does one mister samuel bozzle live here asked trevelyan	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0017.flac	then bozzle came forward and introduced his wife	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0018.flac	but trevelyan was of a different opinion and he was disgusted and revolted most unreasonably by the appearance of his ministers domestic arrangements	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0019.flac	bozzle had always waited upon him with a decent coat and a well brushed hat and clean shoes	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0020.flac	it is very much easier for such men as mister bozzle to carry decency of appearance about with them than to keep it at home	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0021.flac	perhaps you could put on your coat and walk out with me for a few minutes said trevelyan	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0022.flac	missus bozzle who well understood that business was business and that wives were not business felt no anger at this and handed her husband his best coat	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0023.flac	bozzle away from his own home out on business with his coat buttoned over his breast and his best hat in his hand was aware that he commanded respect and he could carry himself accordingly	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0024.flac	i do not suppose that anybody will question my right to have the care of my own child said trevelyan	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0025.flac	if you would have gone to mister skint sir suggested bozzle	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0026.flac	as he went about his eyes were ever cast downwards and he walked with a quick shuffling gait and he suspected others feeling that he himself was suspected	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0027.flac	and all work had ceased with him	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0028.flac	hes up in town sir a minding of his parliamentary duties	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0029.flac	ive watched as sharp as watching can go pretty near	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0030.flac	but if you ask me my opinion why in course theyve been together somewhere	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0031.flac	and bozzle as he said this smiled almost aloud	3536
dev-clean/3536/8226/3536-8226-0032.flac	and he did go away leaving bozzle standing in the middle of stony walk	3536
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0000.flac	master and man dismounted from their beasts and as soon as they had settled themselves at the foot of the trees sancho who had had a good noontide meal that day let himself without more ado pass the gates of sleep	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0001.flac	but don quixote whom his thoughts far more than hunger kept awake could not close an eye and roamed in fancy to and fro through all sorts of places	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0002.flac	at one moment it seemed to him that he was in the cave of montesinos and saw dulcinea transformed into a country wench skipping and mounting upon her she ass again that the words of the sage merlin were sounding in his ears setting forth the conditions to be observed and the exertions to be made for the disenchantment of dulcinea	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0003.flac	who is touching me and untrussing me	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0004.flac	dulcinea is perishing thou art living on regardless i am dying of hope deferred therefore untruss thyself with a good will for mine it is here in this retired spot to give thee at least two thousand lashes	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0005.flac	seeing this sancho got up and grappling with his master he gripped him with all his might in his arms giving him a trip with the heel stretched him on the ground on his back and pressing his right knee on his chest held his hands in his own so that he could neither move nor breathe	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0006.flac	how now traitor exclaimed don quixote	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0007.flac	dost thou revolt against thy master and natural lord	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0008.flac	dost thou rise against him who gives thee his bread	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0009.flac	don quixote gave his promise and swore by the life of his thoughts not to touch so much as a hair of his garments and to leave him entirely free and to his own discretion to whip himself whenever he pleased	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0010.flac	sancho rose and removed some distance from the spot but as he was about to place himself leaning against another tree he felt something touch his head and putting up his hands encountered somebodys two feet with shoes and stockings on them	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0011.flac	he trembled with fear and made for another tree where the very same thing happened to him and he fell a shouting calling upon don quixote to come and protect him	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0012.flac	don quixote did so and asked him what had happened to him and what he was afraid of	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0013.flac	sancho replied that all the trees were full of mens feet and legs	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0014.flac	don quixote was on foot with his horse unbridled and his lance leaning against a tree and in short completely defenceless he thought it best therefore to fold his arms and bow his head and reserve himself for a more favourable occasion and opportunity	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0015.flac	he was mounted upon a powerful horse and had on a coat of mail with four of the pistols they call petronels in that country at his waist	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0016.flac	he saw that his squires for so they call those who follow that trade were about to rifle sancho panza but he ordered them to desist and was at once obeyed so the girdle escaped	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0017.flac	he saw me he paid court to me i listened to him and unknown to my father i loved him for there is no woman however secluded she may live or close she may be kept who will not have opportunities and to spare for following her headlong impulses	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0018.flac	in a word he pledged himself to be mine and i promised to be his without carrying matters any further	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0019.flac	give me my horse and arms and wait for me here i will go in quest of this knight and dead or alive i will make him keep his word plighted to so great beauty	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0020.flac	nobody need have any doubt about that said sancho for my master has a very happy knack of matchmaking its not many days since he forced another man to marry who in the same way backed out of his promise to another maiden and if it had not been for his persecutors the enchanters changing the mans proper shape into a lacqueys the said maiden would not be one this minute	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0021.flac	they made haste to overtake them which as the party moved slowly they were able to do with ease	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0022.flac	the wounded gentleman opened his all but closed eyes and recognising claudia said i see clearly fair and mistaken lady that it is thou that hast slain me a punishment not merited or deserved by my feelings towards thee for never did i mean to nor could i wrong thee in thought or deed	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0023.flac	it is not true then said claudia that thou wert going this morning to marry leonora the daughter of the rich balvastro	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0024.flac	on perceiving this claudia when she had convinced herself that her beloved husband was no more rent the air with her sighs and made the heavens ring with her lamentations she tore her hair and scattered it to the winds she beat her face with her hands and showed all the signs of grief and sorrow that could be conceived to come from an afflicted heart	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0025.flac	cruel reckless woman she cried how easily wert thou moved to carry out a thought so wicked	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0026.flac	o husband whose unhappy fate in being mine hath borne thee from the marriage bed to the grave	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0027.flac	the servants wept claudia swooned away again and again and the whole place seemed a field of sorrow and an abode of misfortune	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0028.flac	claudia told him she meant to go to a monastery of which an aunt of hers was abbess where she intended to pass her life with a better and everlasting spouse	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0029.flac	claudia would not on any account allow him to accompany her and thanking him for his offers as well as she could took leave of him in tears	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0030.flac	sancho said they had but that three kerchiefs that were worth three cities were missing	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0031.flac	what are you talking about man	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0032.flac	said one of the bystanders i have got them and they are not worth three reals	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0033.flac	at this instant one or two of those squires who were posted as sentinels on the roads to watch who came along them and report what passed to their chief came up and said senor there is a great troop of people not far off coming along the road to barcelona	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0034.flac	what led me into it was a certain thirst for vengeance which is strong enough to disturb the quietest hearts	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0035.flac	and if you have any desire to shorten the journey and put yourself easily in the way of salvation come with me and i will show you how to become a knight errant a calling wherein so many hardships and mishaps are encountered that if they be taken as penances they will lodge you in heaven in a trice	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0036.flac	and now the squires despatched to make the prize came up bringing with them two gentlemen on horseback two pilgrims on foot and a coach full of women with some six servants on foot and on horseback in attendance on them and a couple of muleteers whom the gentlemen had with them	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0037.flac	the captains showed plainly the concern they felt the regents lady was downcast and the pilgrims did not at all enjoy seeing their property confiscated	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0038.flac	the regents lady ordered one of her servants to give the eighty crowns that had been assessed as her share at once for the captains had already paid down their sixty	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0039.flac	one of the squires observed in his mixture of gascon and catalan this captain of ours would make a better friar than highwayman if he wants to be so generous another time let it be with his own property and not ours	3576
dev-clean/3576/138058/3576-138058-0040.flac	they were all taken aback and not one of them dared to utter a word such deference did they pay him	3576

dev-clean/3752/4943/3752-4943-0004.flac	about dawn the next morning mister north who amongst other vagaries not approved of by his bishop had a habit of prowling about the prison at unofficial hours was attracted by a dispute at the door of the dormitory	3752

dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0012.flac	yes one oughtnt to leave the colony without seeing it says burgess its worth seeing	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0013.flac	in fact the ringleader john rex gave me his confession and i sent it to the bishop	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0014.flac	a great rascal put in north	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0015.flac	well now said meekin with asperity i dont agree with you	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0016.flac	he seems to me to be truly penitent for his offences a misguided but not a hypocritical man if my knowledge of human nature goes for anything i hope he is said north	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0017.flac	theres no fear of him said burgess cheerily if he grows uproarious well soon give him a touch of the cat	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0018.flac	i suppose severity is necessary returned meekin though to my ears a flogging sounds a little distasteful	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0019.flac	i have these attacks at times	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0020.flac	the reverend meekin eyed his clerical brother with horror the reverend meekin was not accustomed to clergymen who wore black neckties smoked clay pipes chewed tobacco and drank neat brandy out of tumblers	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0021.flac	so they went on to the verandah and looked down upon the lights of the prison and listened to the sea lapping the shore	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0022.flac	by and by a short figure smoking a cheroot came up out of the dark and proved to be doctor macklewain who had been prevented from attending the dinner by reason of an accident to a constable at norfolk bay which had claimed his professional attention	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0023.flac	dead said doctor macklewain	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0024.flac	delighted to see you mister meekin	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0025.flac	but macklewain was tired and wanted to get home	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0026.flac	our roads lie together doctor	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0027.flac	before the two clergymen had got half way down the steep path that led from the commandants house to the flat on which the cottages of the doctor and chaplain were built macklewain rejoined them	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0028.flac	another flogging to morrow said he grumblingly	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0029.flac	whom is he going to flog now	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0030.flac	you dont mean to say hes going to flog kirkland	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0031.flac	perhaps youll have the goodness to allow me to be the best judge of that returned macklewain drawing up his little body to its least insignificant stature	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0032.flac	mister meekin expressed some alarm but doctor macklewain re assured him	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0033.flac	we cant do anything without evidence complain	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0034.flac	i shall find my portmanteau in my room you said yes yes	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0035.flac	he sleeps at the back and north hurried off	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0036.flac	an impulsive gentleman said meekin to macklewain as the sound of mister norths footsteps died away in the distance	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0037.flac	macklewain shook his head seriously	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0038.flac	he has the strangest fits at times	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0039.flac	unless its a cancer in the stomach i dont know what it can be cancer in the stomach	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0040.flac	doctor we all have our crosses have we not	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0041.flac	how delightful the grass smells	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0042.flac	good night sir i hope you will be comfortable	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0043.flac	ill teach my prisoners to attempt suicide	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0044.flac	thats macklewains business	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0045.flac	then dont you interfere with me sir	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0046.flac	ive given my orders sir	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0047.flac	then captain burgess cried north his pale face flushing i tell you the boys blood will be on your head	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0048.flac	i am a minister of god sir and i forbid you to commit this crime	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0049.flac	damn your impertinence sir burst out burgess	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0050.flac	youre a dismissed officer of the government sir	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0051.flac	this of course was mere bravado on the part of the commandant	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0052.flac	north knew well that he would never dare to attempt any such act of violence but the insult stung him like the cut of a whip	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0053.flac	show mister north out he said and go down to the barracks and tell troke that kirkland is to have a hundred lashes to morrow	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0054.flac	ill show you whos master here my good sir	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0055.flac	this is murderous	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0056.flac	the government may go to and you too roared burgess get out	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0057.flac	they shall not flog that boy he said	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0058.flac	ill report this to the government	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0059.flac	i wish i hadnt taken that brandy he said fool that i am	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0060.flac	oh god give me strength aid me help me	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0061.flac	o lord look down upon me	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0062.flac	he mixed a teaspoonful of this in a pannikin of water and drank it	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0063.flac	it relieved him for a while	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0064.flac	it was as though he had reached the crisis of a disease which had been for days gathering force	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0065.flac	i must have a teaspoonful he said to allay the craving	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0066.flac	twice he paused on the way to the sitting room and twice was he driven on by a power stronger than his will	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0067.flac	he smelt the nutty aroma of the spirit	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0068.flac	that at all times debasing at this particular time it was infamous that a vice unworthy of any man was doubly sinful in a man of education and a minister of god in vain	3752
dev-clean/3752/4944/3752-4944-0069.flac	in the midst of his arguments he found himself at the cupboard with the bottle at his lips in an attitude that was at once ludicrous and horrible	3752
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0000.flac	her meeting with letty was indescribably tender and the days that followed were pretty equally divided between her and her brother in nursing the one and loving the other	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0001.flac	but even while she enjoyed every hour of life and begrudged the time given to sleep she felt as if the dream was too beautiful to last and often said	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0002.flac	so christie turned a deaf ear to her prophetic soul and gave herself up to the blissful holiday that had come at last	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0003.flac	nothing can surprise me now im prepared for any thing even the sight of my quakerish lover dancing a jig	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0004.flac	i feel like a boy out of school or rather a man out of prison and must enjoy my liberty in some way	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0005.flac	im not a talker you know and as the laws of gravitation forbid my soaring aloft anywhere i can only express my joyfully uplifted state of mind by prancing as you call it	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0006.flac	i dont want you to i love to see you so young and happy only you are not the old david and ive got to get acquainted with the new one	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0007.flac	i hope youll like him better than the frost bitten old david you first knew and were kind enough to love	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0008.flac	mother says ive gone back to the time before we lost letty and i sometimes feel as if i had	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0009.flac	in that case you will find me a proud impetuous ambitious fellow christie and how will that suit	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0010.flac	excellently i like pride of your sort impetuosity becomes you for you have learned to control it if need be and the ambition is best of all	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0011.flac	i shall wait for time to show	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0012.flac	then they went back to their work little dreaming as they tied roses and twined smilax wreaths how near that other chance was how soon they were to be called upon to keep their promise and how well each was to perform the part given them in life and death	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0013.flac	to no home in the land did the great trouble bring a more sudden change than the little cottage in the lane	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0014.flac	david was sober enough now and went about his work with a grim set to his lips and a spark in his eyes that made the three women look at one another pale with unspoken apprehension	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0015.flac	it is terrible and yet glorious	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0016.flac	david held it close in both of his saying gratefully thank you mother then fixing his eyes on the younger yet not dearer women he added with a ring in his voice that made their hearts answer with a prompt ay ay in spite of love or fear	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0017.flac	the boys bless their brave hearts have done nobly but older men are needed now we cannot sacrifice all the gallant lads and we who have more to lose than they must take our turn and try to do as well	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0018.flac	yes david sister and sweetheart answered bravely forgetting in the fervor of the moment what heavy consequences god might see fit to send good	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0019.flac	bennet will take the garden and green house off my hands this autumn for a year or longer if i like	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0020.flac	hes a kind neighborly man and his boy will take my place about the house and protect you faithfully	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0021.flac	i knew you would go i saw you getting ready and i made up my mind to follow	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0022.flac	you will let me do it and in return i will marry you whenever you ask me answered christie sealing the promise with a kiss that silenced him	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0023.flac	youve something to tell me i see it in your face dear i must go	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0024.flac	next evening as missus sterling sat alone in the twilight a tall man in army blue entered quietly stood watching the tranquil figure for a moment then went and knelt down beside it saying with a most unsoldierly choke in the voice	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0025.flac	the loyal frenzy fell upon the three quiet women and they could not do too much for their country	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0026.flac	it would have taken many knapsacks to hold all the gifts showered upon him by his friends and neighbors	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0027.flac	finding that lisha showed little enthusiasm on the subject she tried to rouse him by patriotic appeals of various sorts	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0028.flac	very well said missus wilkins resolutely to herself ef i cant make no impression on his soul i will on his stommick and see how thatll work	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0029.flac	we cant afford no nice vittles now when our men are sufferin so	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0030.flac	he was not as unmoved as he seemed by the general excitement and had felt sundry manly impulses to up and at em when his comrades in the shop discussed the crisis with ireful brandishing of awls and vengeful pounding of sole leather as if the rebels were under the hammer	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0031.flac	to say that the fish rose at once and swallowed the bait hook and all but feebly expresses the justice done to the cakes by that long suffering man	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0032.flac	can you remember what hepsey told us and call them poor long sufferin creeters names	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0033.flac	no he aint its a trainer added ann lizy	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0034.flac	now cynthy be you satisfied	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0035.flac	and the inconsistent woman fell upon his buttony breast weeping copiously	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0036.flac	his wife fed him with the fat of the land regardless of consequences his children revolved about him with tireless curiosity and wonder his neighbors flocked in to applaud advise and admire every one treated him with a respect most grateful to his feelings he was an object of interest and with every hour his importance increased so that by night he felt like a commander in chief and bore himself accordingly	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0037.flac	then the good soul openly shouldered the burden she had borne so long in secret and bravely trudged on alone	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0038.flac	the women dropped their work to look and listen for his visits were few and short and every instant was precious	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0039.flac	they knew what it was without a word missus sterling clasped her hands and bowed her head	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0040.flac	now lets be brave and enjoy every minute of it	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0041.flac	we will what can i do for you davy asked christie wonderfully supported by the thought that she was going too	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0042.flac	as a married woman you will get on better as my wife you will be allowed to come to me if i need you and as my he stopped there for he could not add as my widow you will have my pension to support you	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0043.flac	nothing can part us any more not even death for love like ours will last for ever	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0044.flac	not one david thats true love christie	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0045.flac	then they stood quite still for a time and in the silence the two hearts talked together in the sweet language no tongue can utter	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0046.flac	surely i shall if i give you and myself to the cause and i do it gladly though i know that my heart has got to ache as it never has ached yet when my courage fails as it will by and by and my selfish soul counts the cost of my offering after the excitement is over	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0047.flac	david caught the exaltation and gave no further thought to any thing but the duty of the hour finding himself stronger and braver for that long look into the illuminated face of the woman he loved	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0048.flac	the roses are for they remind me of poor helen and the first work i did with david was arranging flowers like these for a dead babys little coffin	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0049.flac	but i think few brides dress with a braver happier heart than mine though i do choose a sober wedding gown answered christie smiling again as she took from a half packed trunk her new hospital suit of soft gray woollen stuff	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0050.flac	mister power is waiting are you ready love quite ready	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0051.flac	you young folks take a wedding trip to the green house while we see how well we can get on without you	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0052.flac	david and christie went smiling away together and if they shed any tears over the brief happiness no one saw them but the flowers and they loyally kept the secret folded up in their tender hearts	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0053.flac	a very simple little marriage feast but more love good will and tender wishes adorned the plain table than is often found at wedding breakfasts and better than any speech or song was lettys broken whisper as she folded her arms round davids empty chair when no one saw her heaven bless and keep and bring him back to us	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0054.flac	all watched with quickened breath and proud souls that living wave blue below and bright with a steely glitter above as it flowed down the street and away to join the sea of dauntless hearts that for months had rolled up against the south and ebbed back reddened with the blood of men like these	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0055.flac	then she saw david and the regiment became one man to her	3853
dev-clean/3853/163249/3853-163249-0056.flac	i could not love thee dear so much loved i not honor more	3853
dev-clean/422/122949/422-122949-0000.flac	every elevation of the type man has hitherto been the work of an aristocratic society and so it will always be a society believing in a long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among human beings and requiring slavery in some form or other	422
dev-clean/422/122949/422-122949-0001.flac	the distinctions of moral values have either originated in a ruling caste pleasantly conscious of being different from the ruled or among the ruled class the slaves and dependents of all sorts	422
dev-clean/422/122949/422-122949-0002.flac	we truthful ones the nobility in ancient greece called themselves	422
dev-clean/422/122949/422-122949-0003.flac	it is obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first applied to men and were only derivatively and at a later period applied to actions it is a gross mistake therefore when historians of morals start with questions like why have sympathetic actions been praised	422
dev-clean/422/122949/422-122949-0004.flac	he honours whatever he recognizes in himself such morality equals self glorification	422
dev-clean/422/122949/422-122949-0005.flac	probably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of man will find expression perhaps a condemnation of man together with his situation	422
dev-clean/422/122949/422-122949-0006.flac	here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis good and evil power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil a certain dreadfulness subtlety and strength which do not admit of being despised	422
dev-clean/422/122949/422-122949-0007.flac	according to slave morality therefore the evil man arouses fear according to master morality it is precisely the good man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it while the bad man is regarded as the despicable being	422
dev-clean/422/122949/422-122949-0008.flac	everywhere that slave morality gains the ascendancy language shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words good and stupid	422

dev-clean/5694/64029/5694-64029-0011.flac	i think we must have killed a good many in the old field because we were firing all the time at the solid line as they advanced upon us	5694

dev-clean/5694/64029/5694-64029-0026.flac	as i went back to the field hospital i overtook another man walking along	5694
dev-clean/5694/64029/5694-64029-0027.flac	i looked at it pretty close and i said great god	5694
dev-clean/5694/64029/5694-64029-0028.flac	he was walking along when all at once he dropped down and died without a struggle or a groan	5694

dev-clean/5694/64038/5694-64038-0003.flac	outside of these occasional reminders we could see no evidence of the desolation of the track of an invading army	5694
dev-clean/5694/64038/5694-64038-0004.flac	we saw the united states flag flying from the ramparts and thought that yank would probably be asleep or catching lice or maybe engaged in a game of seven up	5694
dev-clean/5694/64038/5694-64038-0005.flac	he walked up and says hello boys what is it boss	5694

dev-clean/5694/64038/5694-64038-0011.flac	but how to get him out was the unsolved problem	5694

dev-clean/5694/64038/5694-64038-0013.flac	we looked all around and thought that the coast was clear	5694
dev-clean/5694/64038/5694-64038-0014.flac	i dont think his gun was loaded though because we did not hear the ball whistle	5694

dev-clean/5694/64038/5694-64038-0017.flac	how every pulse did beat and leap and how every heart did throb with emotions of joy which seemed nearly akin to heaven when we received the glad intelligence of our onward march toward the land of promise and of our loved ones	5694

dev-clean/5895/34615/5895-34615-0004.flac	it seemed evident that a mysterious and probably occult science which was to surgery what alchemy was to chemistry had chiselled his flesh evidently at a very tender age and manufactured his countenance with premeditation	5895
dev-clean/5895/34615/5895-34615-0005.flac	gwynplaine was a mountebank	5895
dev-clean/5895/34615/5895-34615-0006.flac	he showed himself on the platform	5895
dev-clean/5895/34615/5895-34615-0007.flac	it was gwynplaines laugh which created the laughter of others yet he did not laugh himself	5895

dev-clean/5895/34615/5895-34615-0009.flac	no one could escape from this rictus	5895
dev-clean/5895/34615/5895-34615-0010.flac	all his emotions whatever they might have been augmented his strange face of joy or to speak more correctly aggravated it	5895

dev-clean/5895/34615/5895-34615-0014.flac	with this exception gwynplaines laugh was everlasting	5895
dev-clean/5895/34615/5895-34615-0015.flac	the joyous convulsion of laughter was as a tribute paid they submitted to it gladly but almost mechanically	5895
dev-clean/5895/34615/5895-34615-0016.flac	besides we must remember that they had in those times means of putting patients to sleep and of suppressing all suffering only then it was called magic while now it is called anaesthesia	5895

dev-clean/5895/34615/5895-34615-0019.flac	his hair having probably been dyed with some corrosive preparation had left it woolly and rough to the touch	5895

dev-clean/5895/34622/5895-34622-0007.flac	the astonishment with which the villagers regarded this machine was overwhelming	5895
dev-clean/5895/34622/5895-34622-0008.flac	this was the old establishment of ursus its proportions augmented by success and improved from a wretched booth into a theatre	5895
dev-clean/5895/34622/5895-34622-0009.flac	unknown people had worked upon his face he on the other hand had worked on his mind and behind this well executed mask he had placed all that he could of thought	5895
dev-clean/5895/34622/5895-34622-0010.flac	the effect of his appearance had been surprising	5895
dev-clean/5895/34622/5895-34622-0011.flac	some believed it to be natural others declared it to be artificial and as conjecture was added to reality everywhere at every cross road on the journey in all the grounds of fairs and fetes the crowd ran after gwynplaine	5895
dev-clean/5895/34622/5895-34622-0012.flac	the curiosity of one place exhausted they passed on to another	5895
dev-clean/5895/34622/5895-34622-0013.flac	this fortune had allowed ursus who was the administrator of gwynplaines success to have the chariot of his dreams constructed that is to say a caravan large enough to carry a theatre and to sow science and art in the highways	5895

dev-clean/5895/34622/5895-34622-0022.flac	this opening looked for all the world like a mouth of hell in the words of the itinerant puritan preachers who turned away from it with horror	5895

dev-clean/5895/34629/5895-34629-0005.flac	it was a theatre ready made	5895
dev-clean/5895/34629/5895-34629-0006.flac	against this wall was placed the green box which they were able to draw into the yard owing to the height of the gate	5895

dev-clean/5895/34629/5895-34629-0011.flac	with that exception their success became so great that no mountebank memory could recall its parallel	5895
dev-clean/5895/34629/5895-34629-0012.flac	all southwark ran in crowds to admire the laughing man	5895

dev-clean/5895/34629/5895-34629-0015.flac	besides the small fry the swallowers of swords and the grimace makers real performances took place on the green	5895
dev-clean/5895/34629/5895-34629-0016.flac	even this comedian of jaws and claws was eclipsed in success	5895
dev-clean/5895/34629/5895-34629-0017.flac	that success was prodigious still it remained local	5895

dev-clean/5895/34629/5895-34629-0021.flac	besides this he harangued like cicero as we have just seen sold his drugs attended sickness and even healed the sick	5895
dev-clean/5895/34629/5895-34629-0022.flac	ursus was satisfied with the applause of southwark but by no means astonished	5895
dev-clean/5895/34629/5895-34629-0023.flac	at every performance the yard of the inn transformed into a pit was filled with a ragged and enthusiastic audience	5895
dev-clean/5895/34629/5895-34629-0024.flac	the emptying of tankards did not decrease their success	5895
dev-clean/5895/34629/5895-34629-0025.flac	this connoisseur was suddenly fascinated and had adopted the laughing man	5895
dev-clean/5895/34629/5895-34629-0026.flac	he did not come every evening but when he came he led the public applause grew into acclamation success rose not to the roof for there was none but to the clouds for there were plenty of them	5895
dev-clean/5895/34629/5895-34629-0027.flac	which clouds seeing that there was no roof sometimes wept over the masterpiece of ursus	5895
dev-clean/5895/34629/5895-34629-0028.flac	his enthusiasm caused ursus to remark this man and gwynplaine to observe him	5895
dev-clean/5895/34629/5895-34629-0029.flac	they had a great friend in this unknown visitor	5895
dev-clean/5895/34629/5895-34629-0030.flac	one evening ursus was in the side scene which was the kitchen door of the green box seeing master nicless standing by him showed him this man in the crowd and asked him	5895
dev-clean/5895/34629/5895-34629-0031.flac	what a pity that he should not be a lord	5895
dev-clean/5895/34629/5895-34629-0032.flac	he would make a famous scoundrel	5895
dev-clean/5895/34629/5895-34629-0033.flac	at that hour there was no one in the fair ground except perhaps some reeling drunkard making staggering shadows in dark corners	5895
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0000.flac	on the second of the month at two in the morning our precious cargo of luggage was taken on board the good ship valkyrie	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0001.flac	but in the cause of science men are expected to suffer	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0002.flac	well and have we a fair wind	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0003.flac	my uncle was delighted for myself moody and dissatisfied i appeared almost to expect a glimpse of the ghost of hamlet	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0004.flac	but no ghost or anything else appeared upon the ancient walls	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0005.flac	the fact is the castle is much later than the time of the heroic prince of denmark	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0006.flac	no mister hardwigg said the captain no fear of that	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0007.flac	at all events we shall get there some day	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0008.flac	on the eleventh day we sighted cape portland over which towered mount myrdals yokul which the weather being clear we made out very readily	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0009.flac	the valkyrie kept off the coast steering to the westward	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0010.flac	on all sides were to be seen whole schools of whales and sharks	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0011.flac	nearly the whole population of the town was on foot to see us land	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0012.flac	the fact was that scarcely any one of them but expected some goods by the periodical vessel	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0013.flac	then without further remark he put his finger to his lips frowned darkly and descended into the small boat which awaited us	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0014.flac	he was however but a civil servant a magistrate the governor of the island baron trampe	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0015.flac	the professor knew whom he had to deal with	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0016.flac	this modest scholar spoke no languages save icelandic and latin	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0017.flac	when therefore he addressed himself to me in the language of horace we at once came to understand one another	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0018.flac	now harry said my uncle rubbing his hands an goes well the worse difficulty is now over	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0019.flac	in the meantime there is not an hour to lose	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0020.flac	very likely i may find there some manuscripts from the hand of saknussemm	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0021.flac	i shall be glad to consult them	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0022.flac	they were now however absent on duty	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0023.flac	though not very large it appeared not likely to be filled for centuries	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0024.flac	i have not the slightest doubt that in high winds its red tiles were blown out to the great annoyance of the pastor and congregation	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0025.flac	thanks to the heat of these residences grass grows on the roof which grass is carefully cut for hay	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0026.flac	i saw but few inhabitants during my excursion but i met a crowd on the beach drying salting and loading codfish the principal article of exportation	6241
dev-clean/6241/61943/6241-61943-0027.flac	the men appeared robust but heavy fair haired like germans but of pensive mien exiles of a higher scale in the ladder of humanity than the eskimos but i thought much more unhappy since with superior perceptions they are compelled to live within the limits of the polar circle	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0000.flac	i began to enjoy the exhilarating delight of traveling a life of desire gratification and liberty	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0001.flac	hans our extraordinary guide went first walking with a steady rapid unvarying step	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0002.flac	our two horses with the luggage followed of their own accord without requiring whip or spur	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0003.flac	geographers have divided it into four parts and we had to cross the southwest quarter which in the vernacular is called sudvestr fjordungr	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0004.flac	we took our way through poor and sparse meadows which made a desperate effort every year to show a little green	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0005.flac	they very rarely succeed in a good show of yellow	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0006.flac	i could not help smiling to see him look so big on his little horse his long legs now and then touching the ground made him look like a six footed centaur	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0007.flac	snow tempest impracticable roads rocks icebergs nothing stops him	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0008.flac	we may do so was my reply but what about our worthy guide	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0009.flac	i should have a violent attack of the cramp if i were not to have some sort of exercise	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0010.flac	my arms are right but my legs are getting a little stiff	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0011.flac	here and there could be seen an isolated farm some solitary bur or icelandic house built of wood earth fragments of lava looking like beggars on the highway of life	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0012.flac	a few stray cows and sheep were only seen occasionally	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0013.flac	little did i expect however the spectacle which awaited us when we reached the peninsula of sneffels where agglomerations of natures ruins form a kind of terrible chaos	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0014.flac	it consists simply of a few houses not what in england or germany we should call a hamlet	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0015.flac	i took occasion to consult the map to see where gardar was to be found	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0016.flac	these sacred edifices are however very much like these people who do without watches and never miss them	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0017.flac	to ride over salt water upon the back of a little horse seemed to me absurd	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0018.flac	in any case i shall trust rather to my own intelligence than theirs	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0019.flac	but my uncle was in no humor to wait	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0020.flac	at length the sturdy little pony spreading out his legs in a stiff and ludicrous attitude got from under the professors legs and left him standing with both feet on a separate stone like the colossus of rhodes	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0021.flac	he says tide replied my uncle translating the danish word for my information	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0022.flac	i thoroughly understood and appreciated the necessity for waiting before crossing the fjord for that moment when the sea at its highest point is in a state of slack water	6241
dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0023.flac	accustomed as i had been to the steam ferry boats of the elbe i found the long oars of the boatmen but sorry means of locomotion	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0000.flac	but this power of discernment was denied them and only in after years with the loved ones of their own firesides close about them was the whole picture revealed	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0001.flac	one dark night at the head of a score of his tribe he fell upon wabigoons camp his object being the abduction of the princess	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0002.flac	while the attack was successful in a way its main purpose failed	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0003.flac	a counter attack was made upon woonga and he was driven deep into the wilderness with great loss	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0004.flac	three days later minnetaki became newsomes wife at the hudson bay post	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0005.flac	from that hour dated one of the most sanguinary feuds in the history of the great trading company a feud which as we shall see was destined to live even unto the second generation	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0006.flac	meanwhile two children came to bless the happy union of newsome and his lovely indian wife	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0007.flac	the other was a girl three years younger and newsome insisted that she be called minnetaki	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0008.flac	curiously enough the blood of wabi ran almost pure to his indian forefathers while minnetaki as she became older developed less of the wild beauty of her mother and more of the softer loveliness of the white race her wealth of soft jet black hair and her great dark eyes contrasting with the lighter skin of her fathers blood	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0009.flac	wabi on the other hand was an indian in appearance from his moccasins to the crown of his head swarthy sinewy as agile as a lynx and with every instinct in him crying for the life of the wild	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0010.flac	one of newsomes chief pleasures in life had been the educating of his woodland bride and it was the ambition of both that the little minnetaki and her brother be reared in the ways of white children	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0011.flac	consequently both mother and father began their education at the post they were sent to the factors school and two winters were passed in port arthur that they might have the advantage of thoroughly equipped schools	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0012.flac	the children proved themselves unusually bright pupils and by the time wabi was sixteen and minnetaki twelve one would not have known from their manner of speech that indian blood ran in their veins	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0013.flac	it was at about this time in their lives that the woongas became especially daring in their depredations	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0014.flac	at last so daring did he become that the provincial government placed a price upon his head and upon those of a number of his most notorious followers	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0015.flac	but each week added to his loneliness and his longings for minnetaki and his forests	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0016.flac	necessity had become his grim master and the following week he was going to work	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0017.flac	a thousand plans were made a thousand adventures pictured and the mother would smile and laugh and plan with them	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0018.flac	but in time the end of it all came and wabi went back to the princess mother to minnetaki and to his forests	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0019.flac	there were tears in the boys eyes when they parted and the mother cried for the indian boy who was returning to his people	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0020.flac	spring came and passed and then summer	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0021.flac	we shall make more money up here this winter than you could earn in detroit in three years	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0022.flac	we will hunt wolves the country is alive with them and the government gives a bounty of fifteen dollars for every scalp taken	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0023.flac	three weeks later came wabigoons reply	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0024.flac	on the tenth of october he would meet rod at sprucewood on the black sturgeon river	6241
dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0025.flac	there was little time to lose in making preparations and the fourth day following the receipt of wabis letter found rod and his mother waiting for the train which was to whirl the boy into his new life	6241
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0000.flac	chapter seven the homecoming	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0001.flac	colonel leonidas talbot regarded the white flag with feelings in which triumph and sadness were mingled strangely	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0002.flac	but the emotions of harry and his comrades were for the moment those of victory only	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0003.flac	boats put out both from the fort and the shore	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0004.flac	the smoke itself which had formed a vast cloud over harbor forts and city was now drifting out to sea leaving all things etched sharply in the dazzling sunlight of a southern spring day	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0005.flac	that white flag and those boats going out mean that sumter is ours	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0006.flac	but the negotiations were soon completed	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0007.flac	all the amenities were preserved between the captured garrison and their captors	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0008.flac	the great state of virginia mother of presidents went out of the union at last and north carolina tennessee and arkansas followed her but maryland kentucky and missouri still hung in the balance	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0009.flac	lincoln had called for volunteers to put down a rebellion but harry heard everywhere in charleston that the confederacy was now secure	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0010.flac	the progress of president davis to the new capital set in the very face of the foe was to be one huge triumph of faith and loyalty	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0011.flac	there was not a single note of gloom	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0012.flac	europe which must have its cotton would favor the success of the south	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0013.flac	an extraordinary wave of emotion swept over the south carrying everybody with it	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0014.flac	beauregard at once wrote an order	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0015.flac	colonel kenton writes wisely	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0016.flac	we need kentucky and i understand that a very little more may bring the state to us go with your father i understand that you have been a brave young soldier here and may you do as well up there	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0017.flac	harry feeling pride but not showing it saluted and left the room going at once to madame delaunays where he had left his baggage	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0018.flac	he intended to leave early in the morning but first he sought his friends and told them good bye	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0019.flac	harry gave his farewells with deep and genuine regret	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0020.flac	whether their manner was grave or frivolous he knew that these were good friends of his and he sincerely hoped that he would meet them again	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0021.flac	it was a different harry who started home late in april	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0022.flac	four months had made great changes he bore himself more like a man his manner was much more considered and grave	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0023.flac	he had seen great things and he had done his share of them	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0024.flac	he gazed upon a world full of responsibilities and perils	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0025.flac	but he looked back at charleston the gay the volatile and the beautiful with real affection	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0026.flac	it was almost buried now in flowers and foliage	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0027.flac	he was going home after victory	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0028.flac	he soon left charleston out of sight	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0029.flac	he felt the difference as soon as he reached the hills of his native state	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0030.flac	people were cooler here and they were more prone to look at the two sides of a question	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0031.flac	the air too was unlike that of south carolina there was a sharper tang to it	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0032.flac	it whipped his blood as it blew down from the slopes and crests	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0033.flac	it was afternoon when he reached the little station of winton and left the train a tall sturdy boy the superior of many a man in size strength and agility	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0034.flac	there were never before such times in old kentucky	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0035.flac	bill skelly an his gang them mountaineers are up	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0036.flac	he did not say the last as a boast but merely as an assurance to the liveryman who he saw was anxious on his account	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0037.flac	if youve got pistols just you think once before you shoot said collins	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0038.flac	harry thanked him threw his saddle bags across the horse a powerful bay and giving a final wave of his hand to the sympathetic liveryman rode away	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0039.flac	this was not the fashion of a year ago when they exchanged a friendly word or two but harry knew its cause now nobody could trust anybody else	6295
dev-clean/6295/244435/6295-244435-0040.flac	but he saw nothing that moved there no signal lights twinkled	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0000.flac	one winter evening as soon as his work was over for the day joseph locked the door of his smithy washed himself well put on clean clothes and taking his violin set out for testbridge mary was expecting him to tea	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0001.flac	it was the afternoon of a holiday and she had closed early	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0002.flac	was there ever a happier man than joseph that night as he strode along the footpath	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0003.flac	he pressed his violin case to his heart as if it were a living thing that could know that he loved it	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0004.flac	earth was gone and heaven was all	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0005.flac	blessed am i here now my god and blessed shall i be there then	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0006.flac	when he reached the suburbs the light of homes was shining through curtains of all colors	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0007.flac	just then he was in no mood to think of the sorrows	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0008.flac	the nettle and the dock said joseph	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0009.flac	he was in a mood for music was he not	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0010.flac	he laid down his violin and seated himself where mary told him in her fathers arm chair by the fire	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0011.flac	letty finding herself not quite equal to the emergency came in her turn to call mary she went as quietly as if she were leaving a tiresome visitor	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0012.flac	the music was broken and joseph left alone with the dumb instruments	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0013.flac	but in his hands solitude and a violin were sure to marry in music	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0014.flac	they sat down and listened in silence	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0015.flac	her heart seemed to swell up into her throat and it was all she could do to keep from weeping	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0016.flac	a little longer and she was compelled to yield and the silent tears flowed freely	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0017.flac	letty too was overcome more than ever she had been by music	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0018.flac	let but a mood be strong enough and the soul clothing itself in that mood as with a garment can walk abroad and haunt the world	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0019.flac	it cried aloud that eternity was very long and like a great palace without a quiet room	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0020.flac	nor was this exactly the shape the thing took to the consciousness of the musician	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0021.flac	i love thee i love thee cried the violin and the worship was entreaty that knew not itself	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0022.flac	hast thou yet to learn that the love of the human is love is divine is but a lower form of a part of the love of god	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0023.flac	when thou lovest man or woman or child yea or even dog aright then wilt thou no longer need that i tell thee how god and his christ would not be content with each other alone in the glories even of the eternal original love because they could create more love	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0024.flac	he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how shall he love god whom he hath not seen	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0025.flac	a sob like a bird new born burst from marys bosom	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0026.flac	that enchantment had possessed him usurping as it were the throne of his life and displacing it when it ceased he was not his own master	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0027.flac	he started to conscious confusion only neither knowing where he was nor what he did	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0028.flac	how it happened he never could tell but he brought down his violin with a crash against the piano then somehow stumbled and all but fell	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0029.flac	in the act of recovering himself he heard the neck of his instrument part from the body with a tearing discordant cry like the sound of the ruin of a living world	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0030.flac	his violin was broken but his being was made whole	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0031.flac	his treasure taken type of his self and a woman given him instead	6295
dev-clean/6295/64301/6295-64301-0032.flac	its just like him he murmured	6295
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0000.flac	youll all be over if you dont have a care	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0001.flac	looks like a clump of bushes down there but i aint sure can you make it out	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0002.flac	yes agreed tad that does look like bushes	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0003.flac	dont move around lie perfectly still warned the guide are you hurt	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0004.flac	and that tumbles enough to knock the sense out of a full grown man	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0005.flac	i could not think of allowing any of my charges to take so terrible a risk and	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0006.flac	no i am the lighter of the two urged tad	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0007.flac	i am the one to go after walt if anyone has to ill go down mister thomas	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0008.flac	master tad is right decided the guide gazing at the two boys approvingly	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0009.flac	i protest shouted the professor	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0010.flac	youd have both of us at the bottom if i left it to you to take care of this end	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0011.flac	be sure to fasten him securely to the loop before you give the signal to haul up warned the guide	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0012.flac	are you ready yes	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0013.flac	he tilted his head to look up	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0014.flac	the movement sent his body swaying giddily from side to side	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0015.flac	cautiously placing a hand against the rocks to steady himself tad wisely concluded that hereafter it would not pay to be too curious	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0016.flac	slowly but steadily the slender line was paid out amid a tense silence on the part of the little group at the top of the canyou	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0017.flac	after what seemed to them hours a sharp call from the depths reached their ears	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0018.flac	lige quickly made fast the line to a tree	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0019.flac	i see him called tad his voice sounding hollow and unnatural to those above	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0020.flac	hes so far to the right of me that i cant reach him	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0021.flac	lodged in the branches of a pinyon tree i think it is but he doesnt answer me	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0022.flac	lige leaning over the brink was able to follow the boys movements by the aid of the thin arc of light made by the torch in tads hand	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0023.flac	but from the cautious movements of the light far below them the guide understood that the lad was at work carrying out his part of the task of rescue to the best of his ability	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0024.flac	mebby you think hes having some sort of a picnic down there eh glared lige	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0025.flac	shall we haul up asked lige making a megaphone of his hands yes haul away	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0026.flac	sure thing answered the boy	6313
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313-66125-0027.flac	nor was his sense of security increased when in shifting his position the torch fell from his grasp the fagots scattering as they slipped down between the limbs of the tree and whirling in ever diminishing circles until finally he heard them clatter on the rocks below	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0000.flac	he no doubt would bring food of some kind with him	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0001.flac	with a shout the boys dashed pell mell to meet the pack train and falling in behind the slow moving burros urged them on with derisive shouts and sundry resounding slaps on the animals flanks	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0002.flac	cold water is the most nourishing thing weve touched since last night	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0003.flac	we did not it must have come to life some time during the night and dug its way out laughed tad	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0004.flac	and weve got a surprise for you announced stacy swelling with pride	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0005.flac	jam exclaimed chunky stretching his neck and eyeing the dish longingly	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0006.flac	now fall to young gentlemen directed the professor	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0007.flac	i am free to admit that i am hungry too	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0008.flac	he buried his biscuit under a layer of jam over which he spread a thick coating of honey	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0009.flac	president brown i withdraw my criticism i offer you my humble apologies	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0010.flac	i reckon there are smiled the guide we are in the bear country now	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0011.flac	yes the country is full of caves	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0012.flac	this announcement filled the boys with excitement	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0013.flac	but i know an old settler who will lend us his dog if it is not out	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0014.flac	supper having been finished the party gathered about the camp fire for their evening chat after which admonishing stacy to keep within his tent and not to go borrowing trouble the boys turned in for a sound sleep	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0015.flac	as yet they had been unable to attempt any fancy riding with their ponies owing to the rugged nature of the country through which they had been journeying	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0016.flac	the boys were now all anxiety to start while the ponies after their sunday rest were almost as full of life as were their owners	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0017.flac	the little animals were becoming more sure footed every day and ned said that before the trip was finished jimmie would be able to walk a slack rope	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0018.flac	an early start was made so that the party reached the promised table lands shortly before ten oclock in the forenoon	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0019.flac	a temporary camp was quickly pitched	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0020.flac	the great green field surrounded on all sides by tall trees made the place an ideal one for their purpose	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0021.flac	it was a beautiful race the little indian ponies seeming to enter thoroughly into the spirit of the contest stretching themselves out to their full lengths and with heads on a level with their backs fairly flew across the great plot of green	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0022.flac	all agreed that tads superior horsemanship alone had won the race for him	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0023.flac	galloping into camp the boy fetched his sombrero which he carried well out into the field and tossed away	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0024.flac	then bidding the boys ride up near the spot to watch him he drew off some ten rods and wheeling spurred his pony to a run	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0025.flac	grasping the pommel with the left hand he appeared to dive head first toward the ground	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0026.flac	they saw his long hair almost brush the grass one of his hands swept down and up and once more tad butler rose standing in his stirrups uttering a cowboy yell as he waved the sombrero on high	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0027.flac	the boys howled with delight that is all did save stacy brown	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0028.flac	tad is an experienced rider	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0029.flac	the first time he rode swiftly by it leaning over to look at the hat as he passed holding to the pommel firmly with his left hand	6313

dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0034.flac	at the moment when he freed his left foot from the stirrup he threw his body sharply to the right reaching for the hat without taking the precaution to grasp the pommel	6313
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313-66129-0035.flac	as a result instead of stopping when he reached the hat the boy kept on going	6313

dev-clean/6313/76958/6313-76958-0021.flac	keep a going and if youre lucky youll run plumb into them was the jeering answer as the sleepy cowmen spurred their ponies on toward camp muttering their disapproval of taking along a bunch of boys on a cattle drive	6313
dev-clean/6313/76958/6313-76958-0022.flac	almost before the echoes of his voice had died away a shrill voice piped up from the tail end of the chuck wagon	6313

dev-clean/6313/76958/6313-76958-0031.flac	we had better start the drive this morning	6313
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0000.flac	what a fuss is made about you my dear little friends	6319
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0001.flac	you surely cannot suppose that in a natural state you would be forced to climb regularly up one tall bare stick such as i see you upon now	6319
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0002.flac	your cousin the wild convolvulus whom i left in the fields this morning does no such thing i assure you	6319
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0003.flac	my young plants require heat or they would not live and the pots we are kept in protect us from those cruel wire worms who delight to destroy our roots	6319
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0004.flac	why not allow your silver tufts to luxuriate in a natural manner	6319
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0005.flac	still the rose tree stood out that there must be some great advantages in a gardeners care for she could not pretend to be ignorant of her own superiority to all her wild relations in the woods	6319
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0006.flac	then the wind took another frolic round the garden and made up to the large white lily into whose refined ear he whispered a doubt as to the necessity or advantage of her thick powerful stem being propped up against a stupid ugly stick	6319
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0007.flac	he really grieved to see it	6319
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0008.flac	did that lovely creature suppose that nature who had done so much for her that the fame of her beauty extended throughout the world had yet left her so weak and feeble that she could not support herself in the position most calculated to give her ease and pleasure	6319
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0009.flac	indeed not a flower escaped his mischievous suggestions	6319
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0010.flac	echoed the flowers tremulously as with a sort of fearful pleasure they awaited his approach	6319
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0011.flac	making a sort of eddying circuit round the garden he knocked over the convolvulus pole tore the strips from the stick that held up the white lily loosed all the carnation flowers from their fastenings broke the rose tree down and levelled the sweet peas to the ground	6319
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0012.flac	meanwhile how fared it with the flowers	6319
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0013.flac	oh that she were once more climbing up the friendly fir pole	6319
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0014.flac	the honeysuckle escaped no better and the carnation was ready to die of vexation at finding that her coveted freedom had levelled her to the dirt	6319
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0015.flac	before the day closed the gardener came whistling from his farm work to look over his pretty charges	6319
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0016.flac	but for the sight that awaited him he was not prepared at all	6319
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0017.flac	weeds meanwhile sprang up and a dreary confusion reigned in the once orderly and brilliant little garden	6319
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0018.flac	the mistress had returned and the young lady was with her and hurried at once to her favourite garden	6319
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0019.flac	in this position she remained until a gentle hand was laid upon her shoulder	6319
dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0020.flac	i am not thinking about the garden mamma replied the young girl without lifting up her face we can plant new flowers and tie up even some of these afresh	6319
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0000.flac	in those very early times there was a man named deucalion and he was the son of prometheus	6319
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0001.flac	after jupiter had bound prometheus on mount caucasus and had sent diseases and cares into the world men became very very wicked	6319
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0002.flac	these men he said to his mighty company are nothing but a source of trouble	6319
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0003.flac	but men kept on fighting and robbing even while the rain was pouring down and the sea was coming up over the land	6319
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0004.flac	no one but deucalion the son of prometheus was ready for such a storm	6319
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0005.flac	the day is coming said prometheus when jupiter will send a flood to destroy mankind from the earth	6319
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0006.flac	but deucalion and pyrrha were very sad for they knew that they were the only persons who were left alive in all the land	6319
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0007.flac	is there anything that you wish he asked	6319
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0008.flac	we should like above all things said deucalion to see this land full of people once more for without neighbors and friends the world is a very lonely place indeed	6319
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0009.flac	go on down the mountain said mercury and as you go cast the bones of your mother over your shoulders behind you and with these words he leaped into the air and was seen no more	6319
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0010.flac	what did he mean asked pyrrha	6319
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0011.flac	surely i do not know said deucalion	6319
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0012.flac	when at last they reached the plain they found themselves at the head of a noble company of human beings all eager to serve them	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0000.flac	when at last the queen gave birth to a daughter the king was so overjoyed that he gave a great christening feast the like of which had never before been known	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0001.flac	one of the young fairies overhearing her and fancying she might work some mischief to the little baby went and hid herself behind the hangings in the hall so as to be able to have the last word and undo any harm the old fairy might wish to work	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0002.flac	the turn of the old fairy had now come and she declared while her head shook with malice that the princess should pierce her hand with a spindle and die of the wound	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0003.flac	it is true i cannot entirely undo what my elder has done	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0004.flac	now fifteen years after the princess was born she was with the king and queen at one of their castles and as she was running about by herself she came to a little chamber at the top of a tower and there sat an honest old woman spinning for she had never heard of the kings edict	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0005.flac	she had no sooner taken up the spindle than being hasty and careless she pierced her hand with the point of it and fainted away	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0006.flac	he knew that she would not awake for a hundred years	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0007.flac	one said it was an enchanted castle another that witches lived there but most believed that it was occupied by a great ogre which carried thither all the children he could catch and ate them up one at a time for nobody could get at him through the wood	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0008.flac	the young prince at these words felt himself on fire	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0009.flac	scarcely had he come to the wood when all the trees and thorns which had made such an impenetrable thicket opened on one side and the other to offer him a path	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0010.flac	he entered a large forecourt and stood still with amazement and awe	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0011.flac	but the faces of the men were rosy and the goblets by them had a few drops of wine left	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0012.flac	he entered the guard room there the guards stood drawn up in line with carbines at their shoulders but they were sound asleep	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0013.flac	he passed through one apartment after another where were ladies and gentlemen asleep in their chairs or standing	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0014.flac	i have waited long for you	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0015.flac	they talked for four hours and had not then said half that was in their heads to say	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0016.flac	meanwhile all the rest of the people in the castle had been wakened at the same moment as the princess and they were now extremely hungry	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0017.flac	the lady in waiting became very impatient and at length announced to the princess that they all waited for her	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0018.flac	then the prince took the princess by the hand she was dressed in great splendour but he did not hint that she looked as he had seen pictures of his great grandmother look he thought her all the more charming for that	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0019.flac	the violins and haut boys played old but excellent pieces of music and after supper to lose no time the grand almoner married the royal lovers in the chapel of the castle	6319
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0020.flac	he turned to show them the castle but behold	6319
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0000.flac	when she said good night to beenie and went to her chamber over that where the loved parent and friend would fall asleep no more she felt as if she went walking along to her tomb	6345
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0001.flac	at the time mary had noted nothing of these things now she saw them all as for the first time in minute detail while slowly she went up the stair and through the narrowed ways and heard the same wind that raved alike about the new grave and the old house into which latter for all the bales banked against the walls it found many a chink of entrance	6345
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0002.flac	when she opened the door of it the bright fire which beenie undesired had kindled there startled her the room looked unnatural uncanny because it was cheerful	6345
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0003.flac	she stood for a moment on the hearth and in sad dreamy mood listened to the howling swoops of the wind making the house quiver and shake	6345
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0004.flac	this was her dream as nearly as she could recall it when she came to herself after waking from it with a cry	6345
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0005.flac	she was one of a large company at a house where she had never been before a beautiful house with a large garden behind	6345
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0006.flac	it was a summer night and the guests were wandering in and out at will and through house and garden amid lovely things of all colors and odors	6345
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0007.flac	but she knew nobody and wandered alone in the garden oppressed with something she did not understand	6345
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0008.flac	at the end of it she was in a place of tombs	6345
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0009.flac	she entered and the servants soft footed and silent were busy carrying away the vessels of hospitality and restoring order as if already they prepared for another company on the morrow no one heeded her	6345
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0010.flac	she was lost lost utterly with an eternal loss	6345
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0011.flac	she knew nothing of the place had nowhere to go nowhere she wanted to go had not a thought to tell her what question to ask if she met a living soul	6345
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0012.flac	but living soul there could be none to meet	6345
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0013.flac	she had lost him years and years before and now she saw him he was there and she knew him	6345
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0014.flac	he came to her side and she gave him no greeting	6345
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0015.flac	i know it and there is no waking	6345
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0016.flac	the old time was but a thicker dream and this is truer because more shadowy	6345
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0017.flac	her only life was that she was lost	6345
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0018.flac	shall i pour out my soul into the ear of a mist a fume from my own brain	6345
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0019.flac	thus was she borne away captive of her dead neither willing nor unwilling of life and death equally careless	6345
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345-64257-0020.flac	with that came a pang of intense pain	6345
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345-93302-0000.flac	she herself should have been a poem a lyric in a white gown and green scarf coming to him through the long grass under the blossomed boughs	6345
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345-93302-0001.flac	her hands should have been full of bluebells and she should have held them up to his face in maidenly defence as he sprang forward to take her in his arms	6345
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345-93302-0002.flac	you see that she knew exactly how a tryst is conducted in the pages of the standard poets and of the cheaper weekly journals	6345
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345-93302-0003.flac	she had to the full limit allowed of her reading and her environment the literary sense	6345
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345-93302-0004.flac	and curiously enough she was hardly curious at all about what he might have to say	6345
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345-93302-0005.flac	she only wished for may and the orchard instead of january and the dingy dusty waiting room the plain faced preoccupied travellers the dim desolate weather	6345
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345-93302-0006.flac	the setting of the scene seemed to her all important	6345
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345-93302-0007.flac	it was bitterly cold but the embankment was more romantic than a railway carriage	6345
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345-93302-0008.flac	he had been late he had offered no excuse no explanation	6345
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345-93302-0009.flac	but here the only thing that occurred to her was to stop and look in one of the shops till he should ask her what she was looking at	6345
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345-93302-0010.flac	the keen wind thrust itself even inside the high collar of her jacket	6345
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345-93302-0011.flac	her hands and feet were aching with cold	6345
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345-93302-0012.flac	she would have shared his sorrow and shown herself half wife half angel from heaven in this dark hour	6345
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345-93302-0013.flac	she said how frightfully cold it is	6345
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345-93302-0014.flac	and yesterday i had a letter from her and she seems to expect to think and i thought i ought to tell you darling	6345
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345-93302-0015.flac	a shock of unbelievable relief tingled through her so that was all what was it compared with her fears	6345

dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0022.flac	there was an extraordinary force of suggestion in this posturing	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0023.flac	the famous terrorist had never in his life raised personally as much as his little finger against the social edifice	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0024.flac	the shadow of his evil gift clung to him yet like the smell of a deadly drug in an old vial of poison emptied now useless ready to be thrown away upon the rubbish heap of things that had served their time	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0025.flac	michaelis the ticket of leave apostle smiled vaguely with his glued lips his pasty moon face drooped under the weight of melancholy assent	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0026.flac	he had been a prisoner himself	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0027.flac	his own skin had sizzled under the red hot brand he murmured softly	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0028.flac	you dont understand he began disdainfully but stopped short intimidated by the dead blackness of the cavernous eyes in the face turned slowly towards him with a blind stare as if guided only by the sound	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0029.flac	he gave the discussion up with a slight shrug of the shoulders	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0030.flac	stevie accustomed to move about disregarded had got up from the kitchen table carrying off his drawing to bed with him	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0031.flac	the sheet of paper covered with circles dropped out of his fingers and he remained staring at the old terrorist as if rooted suddenly to the spot by his morbid horror and dread of physical pain	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0032.flac	his scared eyes blazed with indignation it would hurt terribly his mouth dropped open	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0033.flac	comrade ossipons face twitched with exasperation	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0034.flac	i dont say that protested michaelis gently	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0035.flac	his vision of truth had grown so intense that the sound of a strange voice failed to rout it this time	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0036.flac	the coals in the grate settled down with a slight crash and michaelis the hermit of visions in the desert of a penitentiary got up impetuously	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0037.flac	the disdainful pout of comrade ossipons thick lips accentuated the negro type of his face	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0038.flac	he paused then added with modest firmness	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0039.flac	i would call it cannibalistic thats what it is	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0040.flac	they are nourishing their greed on the quivering flesh and the warm blood of the people nothing else	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0041.flac	stevie swallowed the terrifying statement with an audible gulp and at once as though it had been swift poison sank limply in a sitting posture on the steps of the kitchen door	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0042.flac	he closed the door behind their backs with restrained violence turned the key shot the bolt	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0043.flac	he was not satisfied with his friends	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0044.flac	with the insight of a kindred temperament he pronounced his verdict	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0045.flac	there are natures too to whose sense of justice the price exacted looms up monstrously enormous odious oppressive worrying humiliating extortionate intolerable those are the fanatics	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0046.flac	in any case he had not the time	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0047.flac	loafing was all very well for these fellows who knew not mister vladimir and had women to fall back upon whereas he had a woman to provide for	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0048.flac	these were but few and for the first time since he opened his shop he took a commercial survey of its value	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0049.flac	this survey was unfavourable	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0050.flac	he took the cash box out of the drawer and turning to leave the shop became aware that stevie was still downstairs	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0051.flac	he looked dubiously at his brother in law but he did not ask him for information	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0052.flac	mister verloc perceived with some surprise that he did not know really what to say to stevie	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0053.flac	he stood still in the middle of the parlour and looked into the kitchen in silence	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0054.flac	he watched him gesticulating and murmuring in the kitchen	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0055.flac	stevie prowled round the table like an excited animal in a cage	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0056.flac	the light thrown down by the shade fell dazzlingly on the white pillow sunk by the weight of her head reposing with closed eyes and dark hair done up in several plaits for the night	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0057.flac	her bare feet as if poked through the bottom of an unadorned sleeved calico sack buttoned tightly at neck and wrists felt over the rug for the slippers while she looked upward into her husbands face	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0058.flac	there is no occupation that fails a man more completely than that of a secret agent of police	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0059.flac	its like your horse suddenly falling dead under you in the midst of an uninhabited and thirsty plain	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0060.flac	the comparison occurred to mister verloc because he had sat astride various army horses in his time and had now the sensation of an incipient fall	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0061.flac	the prospect was as black as the window pane against which he was leaning his forehead	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0062.flac	yes not at all well	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0063.flac	down below in the quiet narrow street measured footsteps approached the house then died away unhurried and firm as if the passer by had started to pace out all eternity from gas lamp to gas lamp in a night without end and the drowsy ticking of the old clock on the landing became distinctly audible in the bedroom	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0064.flac	that poor boy is in a very excited state to night she murmured after a pause which lasted for three ticks of the clock	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0065.flac	this dread led him to make the remark that stevie had disregarded his suggestion to go to bed	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0066.flac	there was no young man of his age in london more willing and docile than stephen she affirmed none more affectionate and ready to please and even useful as long as people did not upset his poor head	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0067.flac	mister verlocs anxieties had prevented him from attaching any sense to what his wife was saying	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0068.flac	that boy hears too much of what is talked about here	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0069.flac	if i had known they were coming to night i would have seen to it that he went to bed at the same time i did	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0070.flac	he was out of his mind with something he overheard about eating peoples flesh and drinking blood whats the good of talking like that	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0071.flac	mister verloc was fully responsive now	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0072.flac	ask karl yundt he growled savagely	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0073.flac	he isnt fit to hear whats said here he believes its all true	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0074.flac	he knows no better he gets into his passions over it	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0075.flac	he glared at me as if he didnt know who i was when i went downstairs	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0076.flac	i wish he had never been to school missus verloc began again brusquely	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0077.flac	he gets a red face poring over them	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0078.flac	i wouldnt give a halfpenny for the whole lot	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0079.flac	the other day stevie got hold of one and there was a story in it of a german soldier officer tearing half off the ear of a recruit and nothing was done to him for it the brute	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0080.flac	he cant stand the notion of any cruelty	777
dev-clean/777/126732/777-126732-0081.flac	comfortable dear	777
dev-clean/7850/111771/7850-111771-0000.flac	through the influence of hon thomas l hamer he was admitted at west point in eighteen thirty nine	7850
dev-clean/7850/111771/7850-111771-0001.flac	at this time grant was not taken with war and probably evinced little interest in army tactics	7850
dev-clean/7850/111771/7850-111771-0002.flac	grant acted as mustering officer until being commissioned colonel of the twenty first illinois volunteers he took the field	7850
dev-clean/7850/111771/7850-111771-0003.flac	general halleck in speaking of this battle said	7850
dev-clean/7850/111771/7850-111771-0004.flac	indeed if ever a general deserved honor grant had won it he had opened the mississippi to navigation and had captured nearly one hundred thousand prisoners and arms	7850
dev-clean/7850/111771/7850-111771-0005.flac	he was now commander of all the federal forces	7850
dev-clean/7850/111771/7850-111771-0006.flac	the capture of lee was a far more difficult undertaking	7850
dev-clean/7850/111771/7850-111771-0007.flac	time wore away and on the ninth of april eighteen sixty five grant captured the confederate army under lee thus virtually ending the war	7850
dev-clean/7850/111771/7850-111771-0008.flac	when his public services were finished he started in company with his wife son jesse and a few friends	7850
dev-clean/7850/111771/7850-111771-0009.flac	his success seems to have been the outgrowth of hard study and ability to perform the most exhaustive labor without fatigue	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0000.flac	some are wonderfully wrought pretty little homes for birdikins	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0001.flac	indeed it is not a nest at all only the beginning of one	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0002.flac	and there is an old story about this which i shall tell you	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0003.flac	oh what shall we do for a home	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0004.flac	and the poor silly things ruffled up their feathers and looked miserable as only a little bird can look when it is unhappy	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0005.flac	she was indeed a clever bird	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0006.flac	she popped into her new house and sat there comfortably peering out through the window slits with her sharp little eyes	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0007.flac	and she saw the other birds hopping about and twittering helplessly	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0008.flac	then all the other birds chirped eagerly yes yes let us ask her to teach us	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0009.flac	so in a great company they came fluttering hopping twittering up to the elm tree where mother magpie nestled comfortably in her new house	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0010.flac	o wise mother magpie dear mother magpie they cried teach us how to build our nests like yours for it is growing night and we are tired and sleepy	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0011.flac	the magpie said she would teach them if they would be a patient diligent obedient class of little birds	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0012.flac	and where each bird perched there it was to build its nest	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0013.flac	she began to show them how to weave the bits of things together into nests as they should be made	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0014.flac	and some of the birds who were attentive and careful soon saw how it was done and started nice homes for themselves	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0015.flac	i thought that was the way to begin	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0016.flac	certainly of course screamed the jackdaw	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0017.flac	here wood pigeon said mother magpie you must place those sticks through and across criss cross criss cross so	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0018.flac	criss cross criss cross so interrupted the wood pigeon	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0019.flac	you say you know all about it then go on and finish your nests by yourselves	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0020.flac	much luck may you have	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0021.flac	and away she flew to her own cosy nest in the elm tree where she was soon fast asleep forgetting all about the matter	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0022.flac	but the wood pigeon was in the worst case of them all	7850
dev-clean/7850/281318/7850-281318-0023.flac	for she had only the foundation laid criss cross as the magpie had shown her	7850
dev-clean/7850/286674/7850-286674-0000.flac	a person would think that after a family had lived so long in a place all the neighbors would be fond of them yet it is not so	7850
dev-clean/7850/286674/7850-286674-0001.flac	it is disgraceful	7850
dev-clean/7850/286674/7850-286674-0002.flac	they thought the trouble came from bad bringing up or no bringing up at all	7850
dev-clean/7850/286674/7850-286674-0003.flac	they always ate plain food and plenty of it and they never ate between meals	7850
dev-clean/7850/286674/7850-286674-0004.flac	you would think that with six legs apiece and three joints in each leg they might walk quite fast yet they never did	7850
dev-clean/7850/286674/7850-286674-0005.flac	they did not breathe it into their mouths or through gills but took it in through some openings in the back part of their bodies	7850
dev-clean/7850/286674/7850-286674-0006.flac	both lips asked the larvae	7850
dev-clean/7850/286674/7850-286674-0007.flac	well our lower lips anyway answered the nymph	7850
dev-clean/7850/286674/7850-286674-0008.flac	our upper lips are so small they dont matter	7850
dev-clean/7850/286674/7850-286674-0009.flac	they knew that whenever they stuck out their lower lips at the small fishes and bugs they swam away as fast as they could	7850
dev-clean/7850/286674/7850-286674-0010.flac	indeed the lower lip of a dragon fly child might well frighten people for it is fastened on a long jointed arm like thing and has pincers on it with which it catches and holds its food	7850
dev-clean/7850/286674/7850-286674-0011.flac	but sometimes he straightens the joint and holds his lip out before him and then its pincers catch hold of things he does this when he is hungry	7850
dev-clean/7850/286674/7850-286674-0012.flac	scared dah whos afraid answered he	7850
dev-clean/7850/286674/7850-286674-0013.flac	here comes the snapping turtle	7850
dev-clean/7850/286674/7850-286674-0014.flac	sure enough there he came through the shallow water his wet back shell partly out of it and shining in the sunlight	7850
dev-clean/7850/286674/7850-286674-0015.flac	they thought he might be going to take a nap after his dinner	7850
dev-clean/7850/286674/7850-286674-0016.flac	he began to draw in his legs very very slowly and just as his great hard lower shell touched the mud the last larva crawled out under his tail	7850
dev-clean/7850/286674/7850-286674-0017.flac	the nymphs had already gotten away	7850
dev-clean/7850/73752/7850-73752-0000.flac	ferdinand meditates over his good fortune	7850
dev-clean/7850/73752/7850-73752-0001.flac	in moments of deep feeling alike sudden bursts of prosperity as in darker hours man must be alone	7850
dev-clean/7850/73752/7850-73752-0002.flac	it requires some self communion to prepare ourselves for good fortune as well as to encounter difficulty and danger and disgrace	7850
dev-clean/7850/73752/7850-73752-0003.flac	this violent and triumphant revolution in his prospects and his fortunes was hardly yet completely comprehended by our friend ferdinand armine and when he had left a note for the generous mirabel whose slumbers he would not disturb at this early hour even with good news he strolled along up charles street and to the park in one of those wild and joyous reveries in which we brood over coming bliss and create a thousand glorious consequences	7850
dev-clean/7850/73752/7850-73752-0004.flac	ferdinand felt his freedom as well as his happiness	7850
dev-clean/7850/73752/7850-73752-0005.flac	it was indeed her handwriting	7850
dev-clean/7850/73752/7850-73752-0006.flac	restless with impending joy he sauntered to the bridge and leant over the balustrade gazing on the waters in charmed and charming vacancy	7850
dev-clean/7850/73752/7850-73752-0007.flac	how many incidents how many characters how many feelings flitted over his memory of what sweet and bitter experience did he not chew the cud	7850
dev-clean/7850/73752/7850-73752-0008.flac	four and twenty hours ago and he deemed himself the most miserable and forlorn of human beings and now all the blessings of the world seemed showered at his feet	7850
dev-clean/7850/73752/7850-73752-0009.flac	the most gifted individuals in the land emulated each other in proving which entertained for him the most sincere affection	7850
dev-clean/7850/73752/7850-73752-0010.flac	he could not flatter himself that he indeed merited such singular blessings and yet with all his faults which with him were but the consequences of his fiery youth ferdinand had been faithful to henrietta	7850
dev-clean/7850/73752/7850-73752-0011.flac	his constancy to her was now rewarded	7850
dev-clean/7850/73752/7850-73752-0012.flac	as for his friends the future must prove his gratitude to them	7850
dev-clean/7850/73752/7850-73752-0013.flac	it was indeed dancing on a volcano	7850
dev-clean/7850/73752/7850-73752-0014.flac	and now all had ended so happily	7850
dev-clean/7850/73752/7850-73752-0015.flac	was it not all a dream of his own creation while his eye had been fixed in abstraction on that bright and flowing river	7850
dev-clean/7850/73752/7850-73752-0016.flac	he might be enchanted but that was the talisman	7850
dev-clean/7850/73752/7850-73752-0017.flac	in the present unsettled though hopeful state of affairs ferdinand would not go home	7850
dev-clean/7850/73752/7850-73752-0018.flac	in exactly ten minutes it is in the power of every man to free himself from all the tumult of the world the pangs of love the throbs of ambition the wear and tear of play the recriminating boudoir the conspiring club the rattling hell and find himself in a sublime sylvan solitude superior to the cedars of lebanon and inferior only in extent to the chestnut forests of anatolia	7850
dev-clean/7850/73752/7850-73752-0019.flac	is papa alone enquired miss temple	7850
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0000.flac	grant was only a few miles away but although commander in chief he knew nothing of the hardest fought battle of the civil war until it was over	7976

dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0002.flac	our brigade was fearfully outnumbered	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0003.flac	there were no breastworks yet that one little brigade of hamiltons division stood there in the open and repulsed assault after assault	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0004.flac	not balaklava nor the alma saw such fighting it was a duel to the death	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0005.flac	no battery in the whole four years war lost so many men in so short a time	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0006.flac	one daring rebel was shot down and bayoneted clear behind the line of company b where he had broken through to seize the flag of my regiment	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0007.flac	that night the enemy slipped away leaving hundreds and hundreds of his dead and wounded on the field	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0008.flac	with a few lanterns our men then went about and tried to gather up the wounded the dead were left till morning	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0009.flac	it was not a question who was dead or wounded but who was not	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0010.flac	fifteen officers of our little half regiment were dead or wounded	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0011.flac	i remained awake all night talking with a comrade who shared my blanket with me poor jimmy king	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0012.flac	he survived the war only to be murdered later on a plantation in mississippi	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0013.flac	when morning came the firing opened and for all that day the battle raged fiercely at the left and center left we getting the worst of it too	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0014.flac	that evening an order came for us hamiltons division to assault the enemys left flank at midnight	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0015.flac	under the same quiet moonlight and only six hundred yards away from us also lay the victorious rebel army	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0016.flac	once in the night i slipped away from the bivouac and hurried to the old tishimingo hotel to see a lieutenant of my company who had been shot through the breast	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0017.flac	i could not help my friend	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0018.flac	go back to the regiment he said smiling all will be needed	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0019.flac	my friend with many others was being carried out to die elsewhere	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0020.flac	i hastened back to the lines	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0021.flac	the cloud of rebels we had seen divided itself into three columns	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0022.flac	a perfect blaze of close range musketry too mowed them down like grass	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0023.flac	they lay in heaps of dozens even close up to the works	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0024.flac	that night i stood guard under an oak tree on the battlefield among the unburied dead	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0025.flac	indeed we of the rank and file had little confidence in grant in those days	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0026.flac	rosecrans protested it was in vain	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0027.flac	it required months and great events to make grant the hero of the army which he afterward became	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0028.flac	for some reason the dead at hatchie bridge were not buried	7976
dev-clean/7976/105575/7976-105575-0029.flac	a week after the battle my brother rode by there on a cavalry expedition and made the horrible discovery that hogs were eating up the bodies of our dead heroes that too was war	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0000.flac	long ago there lived a merchant who had three daughters	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0001.flac	every year at a certain day of a certain month he went away to a distant city to collect money on an account	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0002.flac	how do you know asked their father i am older and wiser than you are and i know that there are many evils which might come upon you	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0003.flac	when it was evening he led his band into a nearby street and in his disguise approached the merchants house he knocked at the door	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0004.flac	have pity upon a poor unfortunate one he called out	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0005.flac	let me enter i pray you to pass the night under your roof	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0006.flac	its surely a terrible storm outside said the merchants eldest daughter as the wind rattled the tiles of the roof and the rain beat in torrents against the doors and windows	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0007.flac	he is old as well as poor she said	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0008.flac	if we decide to show mercy to this poor beggar it is not for you to oppose it	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0009.flac	bui we should not forget our promise to our father cried the youngest daughter	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0010.flac	however in spite of all she could say the elder sisters opened the door and admitted the beggar	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0011.flac	it is a fearful night to send away a beggar said the eldest sister while they were eating	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0012.flac	while they were talking the beggar had taken the apples which the girls were to eat for dessert and had sprinkled a sleeping powder over them	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0013.flac	the two eldest ate their apples but the youngest could not eat that night she threw the apple away	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0014.flac	she did not stir and he knew that the sleeping powder had thoroughly done its work	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0015.flac	then she heard him go down the stairway and unbolt the heavy doors which led into the store	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0016.flac	it was the youngest one who deceived me cried the robber chieftain	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0017.flac	perhaps you can outwit her yet cried another	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0018.flac	the merchants daughter at first did not answer but as he kept on calling to her she finally asked him what it was that he wanted	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0019.flac	i promise you i will do you no harm	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0020.flac	you shall not come into my fathers house	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0021.flac	pass the charm out to me then said the robber	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0022.flac	when she returned his hand was sticking through the hole in the door	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0023.flac	the cries and curses of the robbers filled the air	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0024.flac	they tried in vain to break down the great doors	7976
dev-clean/7976/110124/7976-110124-0025.flac	all my worries about you were foolish	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0000.flac	he had little enough to break or bite and once when there was a great famine in the land he could hardly procure even his daily bread and as he lay thinking in his bed one night he sighed and said to his wife what will become of us	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0001.flac	how can we feed our children when we have no more than we can eat ourselves	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0002.flac	oh you simpleton said she then we must all four die of hunger you had better plane the coffins for us	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0003.flac	but she left him no peace till he consented saying ah but i shall miss the poor children	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0004.flac	and as soon as their parents had gone to sleep he got up put on his coat and unbarring the back door went out	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0005.flac	ah father said hansel i am looking at my white cat sitting upon the roof of the house and trying to say good bye	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0006.flac	but in reality hansel was not looking at a cat but every time he stopped he dropped a pebble out of his pocket upon the path	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0007.flac	but her husband felt heavy at heart and thought it were better to share the last crust with the children	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0008.flac	early in the morning the stepmother came and pulled them out of bed and gave them each a slice of bread which was still smaller than the former piece	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0009.flac	we are going into the forest to hew wood and in the evening when we are ready we will come and fetch you again	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0010.flac	hansel thought the roof tasted very nice and so he tore off a great piece while grethel broke a large round pane out of the window and sat down quite contentedly	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0011.flac	come in and stop with me and no harm shall come to you and so saying she took them both by the hand and led them into her cottage	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0012.flac	the old woman behaved very kindly to them but in reality she was a wicked old witch who way laid children and built the breadhouse in order to entice them in but as soon as they were in her power she killed them cooked and ate them and made a great festival of the day	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0013.flac	then she took up hansel with her rough hand and shut him up in a little cage with a lattice door and although he screamed loudly it was of no use	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0014.flac	grethel began to cry but it was all useless for the old witch made her do as she wanted	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0015.flac	grethel she cried in a passion get some water quickly be hansel fat or lean this morning i will kill and cook him	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0016.flac	dear good god help us now she prayed	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0017.flac	creep in said the witch and see if it is hot enough and then we will put in the bread but she intended when grethel got in to shut up the oven and let her bake so that she might eat her as well as hansel	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0018.flac	see i could even get in myself	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0019.flac	and she got up and put her head into the oven	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0020.flac	and now as there was nothing to fear they went back to the witchs house where in every corner were caskets full of pearls and precious stones	7976
dev-clean/7976/110523/7976-110523-0021.flac	then they began to run and rushing into the house they fell upon their fathers neck	7976
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0000.flac	not having heard from captain bennydeck for some little time randal thought it desirable in sydneys interests to make inquiries at his club	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0001.flac	the sailing master announced that he had orders to take the vessel back to her port with no other explanation than that the cruise was over	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0002.flac	this alternative in the captains plans terminating the voyage a month earlier than his arrangements had contemplated puzzled randal	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0003.flac	randal waited a while in london on the chance that bennydeck might pay him a visit	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0004.flac	he is staying at this hotel to try the air of sydenham and he finds that it agrees with him	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0005.flac	had her beauty fascinated him	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0006.flac	randal wrote to accept the invitation determining to present himself before the appointed hour and to question catherine privately without giving her the advantage over him of preparing herself for the interview	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0007.flac	after months of separation he received a visit from herbert	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0008.flac	you distress me herbert more than words can say	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0009.flac	he drank the wine greedily	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0010.flac	whatever reviving effect it might otherwise have produced on him it made no change in the threatening gloom of his manner	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0011.flac	he put down the empty glass taking no notice of his brothers question	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0012.flac	randal he said you know where sydney is	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0013.flac	i will do neither the one nor the other	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0014.flac	you dont know what it is to be used to seeing a pretty creature always nicely dressed always about the room thinking so much of you and so little of herself and then to be left alone as i am left out in the dark	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0015.flac	im alone do you hear that alone	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0016.flac	i havent courage enough to do it for myself	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0017.flac	oh why did i engage that governess	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0018.flac	im afraid he said	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0019.flac	i tried it yesterday it set my brains on fire im feeling that glass i took just now	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0020.flac	he paused and put his hand to his fevered head	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0021.flac	was his mind wandering into some other train of thought	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0022.flac	you cant do it	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0023.flac	let me hear what it is first	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0024.flac	i feel for you herbert he said warmly	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0025.flac	she shall have your message all that i can do to persuade her shall be done	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0026.flac	let me rest a little he pleaded if im not in the way	8297
dev-clean/8297/275154/8297-275154-0027.flac	he mentioned the name of one of the old servants at mount morven who had attached himself to randal after the breakup of the family	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0000.flac	on the next day but one randal arranged his departure for sydenham so as to arrive at the hotel an hour before the time appointed for the dinner	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0001.flac	the new number of a popular weekly journal had that day been published randal bought it	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0002.flac	after reading one or two of the political articles he arrived at the columns specially devoted to fashionable intelligence	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0003.flac	randal looked again at the first words in the paragraph	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0004.flac	with his own suspicions steadily contradicting him he arrived at the hotel obstinately believing that the charming widow would prove to be a stranger	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0005.flac	missus norman and her little daughter were out driving with a friend and were expected to return in good time for dinner	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0006.flac	missus presty was at home she was reported to be in the garden of the hotel	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0007.flac	how nice of you to come so soon she began	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0008.flac	she added looking at him suspiciously	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0009.flac	but you ought to have known that we are only half an hour behind you at sydenham in the matter of news	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0010.flac	the report is premature my good friend	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0011.flac	but if these newspaper people waited to find out whether a report is true or false how much gossip would society get in its favorite newspapers	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0012.flac	you are to understand that catherine is a widow	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0013.flac	sit down said missus presty	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0014.flac	you shall hear how my divorced daughter and my poor little grandchild were treated at sandyseal after you left us	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0015.flac	you would have seen her pining for the company of other children and would have had no mercy on her	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0016.flac	he was introduced to missus norman and to missus normans little girl and we were all charmed with him	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0017.flac	when he and i happened to be left together he naturally wondered after having seen the beautiful wife where the lucky husband might be	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0018.flac	and the captain of course concluded after having been introduced to kitty that missus norman was a widow	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0019.flac	worse stories have been printed i do assure you worse stories have been printed	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0020.flac	before i consented to answer the childs inquiries i came to an understanding with her mother	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0021.flac	honestly	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0022.flac	after that i had her mothers authority for telling kitty that she would never see her father again	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0023.flac	she asked directly if her father was dead	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0024.flac	that will do missus presty your defense is thoroughly worthy of your conduct in all other respects	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0025.flac	randal passed this over without notice	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0026.flac	a very wise decision she remarked	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0027.flac	have you any message for captain bennydeck	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0028.flac	not at the hotel just now	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0029.flac	it was a relief to randal in the present state of catherines relations toward bennydeck to return to london without having seen his friend	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0030.flac	good by dear randal	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0031.flac	arrived at the station randal found that he must wait for the train	8297
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297-275155-0032.flac	while he was walking up and down the platform with a mind doubly distressed by anxiety about his brother and anxiety about sydney the train from london came in	8297
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297-275156-0000.flac	what are you doing here he asked	8297
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297-275156-0001.flac	you have been to the hotel he burst out you have seen catherine	8297
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297-275156-0002.flac	we have both seen the same newspaper of course and you have been the first to clear the thing up thats it isnt it	8297
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297-275156-0003.flac	not satisfied with gossip in private the greedy public appetite devours gossip in print and wants more of it than any one editor can supply	8297
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297-275156-0004.flac	supposing the report had been true	8297
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297-275156-0005.flac	in the meantime after what missus presty had confessed the cruel falsehood which had checked poor kittys natural inquiries raised an insuperable obstacle to a meeting between father and child	8297
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297-275156-0006.flac	he had promised to do his best toward persuading catherine to grant sydney an interview	8297
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297-275156-0007.flac	even the chance of successfully confiding her to bennydecks protection had lost something of its fair promise since randals visit to sydenham	8297
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297-275156-0008.flac	be the results however what they might randal could see but one plain course before him now	8297
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297-275156-0009.flac	considerations of delicacy seemed to forbid taking this liberty even with an intimate friend	8297
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297-275156-0010.flac	what happier future could await her especially if she justified randals past experience of all that was candid and truthful in her character than to become his friends wife	8297
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297-275156-0011.flac	shall i say that she may expect an early visit from you when i see her to morrow	8297
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297-275156-0012.flac	he added sydneys address in a postscript and dispatched his letter that evening	8297
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297-275156-0013.flac	but it might perhaps be excusable to infer that the marriage had not yet been decided on and that the captains proposals were still waiting for catherines reply	8297
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0000.flac	go do you hear	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0001.flac	but in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0002.flac	at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became bloodshot the veins of the throat swelled his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with epilepsy nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0003.flac	and the cry issued from his pores if we may thus speak a cry frightful in its silence	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0004.flac	davrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0005.flac	davrigny unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion turned away and villefort without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn extended his hand towards the young man	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0006.flac	for some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs exclamations and prayers	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0007.flac	what do you mean sir	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0008.flac	oh you rave sir exclaimed villefort in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken i rave	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0009.flac	do you know the assassin asked morrel	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0010.flac	noirtier looked upon morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which had so often made valentine happy and thus fixed his attention	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0011.flac	said morrel sadly yes replied noirtier	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0012.flac	the old mans eyes remained fixed on the door	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0013.flac	asked morrel yes	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0014.flac	must i leave alone no	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0015.flac	but can he understand you yes	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0016.flac	gentlemen he said in a hoarse voice give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves the two men drew back	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0017.flac	my father has revealed the culprits name my father thirsts for revenge as much as you do yet even he conjures you as i do to keep this secret do you not father	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0018.flac	morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0019.flac	the old man made a sign in the affirmative	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0020.flac	it was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of noirtier whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0021.flac	but he stopped on the landing he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0022.flac	the two doctors therefore entered the room alone	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0023.flac	noirtier was near the bed pale motionless and silent as the corpse	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0024.flac	the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the lips	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0025.flac	the nearest said the district doctor is a good italian abbe who lives next door to you shall i call on him as i pass	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0026.flac	davrigny said villefort be so kind i beseech you as to accompany this gentleman here is the key of the door so that you can go in and out as you please you will bring the priest with you and will oblige me by introducing him into my childs room do you wish to see him	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0027.flac	i only wish to be alone you will excuse me will you not	84
dev-clean/84/121123/84-121123-0028.flac	i am going sir and i do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0000.flac	but with full ravishment the hours of prime singing received they in the midst of leaves that ever bore a burden to their rhymes	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0001.flac	all waters that on earth most limpid are would seem to have within themselves some mixture compared with that which nothing doth conceal	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0002.flac	thou makest me remember where and what proserpina that moment was when lost her mother her and she herself the spring	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0003.flac	i do not think there shone so great a light under the lids of venus when transfixed by her own son beyond his usual custom	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0004.flac	ye are new comers and because i smile began she peradventure in this place elect to human nature for its nest	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0005.flac	some apprehension keeps you marvelling but the psalm delectasti giveth light which has the power to uncloud your intellect	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0006.flac	the good supreme sole in itself delighting created man good and this goodly place gave him as hansel of eternal peace	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0007.flac	by his default short while he sojourned here by his default to weeping and to toil he changed his innocent laughter and sweet play	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0008.flac	this every other savour doth transcend and notwithstanding slaked so far may be thy thirst that i reveal to thee no more	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0009.flac	between her steps and mine were not a hundred when equally the margins gave a turn in such a way that to the east i faced	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0010.flac	nor even thus our way continued far before the lady wholly turned herself unto me saying brother look and listen	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0011.flac	now helicon must needs pour forth for me and with her choir urania must assist me to put in verse things difficult to think	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0012.flac	then back i turned my face to those high things which moved themselves towards us so sedately they had been distanced by new wedded brides	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0013.flac	and i beheld the flamelets onward go leaving behind themselves the air depicted and they of trailing pennons had the semblance so that it overhead remained distinct with sevenfold lists all of them of the colours whence the suns bow is made and delias girdle	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0014.flac	these standards to the rearward longer were than was my sight and as it seemed to me ten paces were the outermost apart	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0015.flac	the interval between these four contained a chariot triumphal on two wheels which by a griffins neck came drawn along	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0016.flac	not only rome with no such splendid car eer gladdened africanus or augustus but poor to it that of the sun would be	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0017.flac	three maidens at the right wheel in a circle came onward dancing one so very red that in the fire she hardly had been noted	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0018.flac	the second was as if her flesh and bones had all been fashioned out of emerald the third appeared as snow but newly fallen	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0019.flac	in rear of all the group here treated of two old men i beheld unlike in habit but like in gait each dignified and grave	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0020.flac	and when the car was opposite to me thunder was heard and all that folk august seemed to have further progress interdicted	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0021.flac	and one of them as if by heaven commissioned singing veni sponsa de libano shouted three times and all the others after	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0022.flac	as soon as on my vision smote the power sublime that had already pierced me through ere from my boyhood i had yet come forth	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0023.flac	to the left hand i turned with that reliance with which the little child runs to his mother when he has fear or when he is afflicted	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0024.flac	to say unto virgilius not a drachm of blood remains in me that does not tremble i know the traces of the ancient flame	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0025.flac	dante because virgilius has departed do not weep yet do not weep yet awhile for by another sword thou needst must weep	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0026.flac	i saw the lady who erewhile appeared veiled underneath the angelic festival direct her eyes to me across the river	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0027.flac	look at me well in sooth im beatrice	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0028.flac	ye keep your watch in the eternal day so that nor night nor sleep can steal from you one step the ages make upon their path	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0029.flac	therefore my answer is with greater care that he may hear me who is weeping yonder so that the sin and dole be of one measure	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0030.flac	but by the largess of celestial graces which have such lofty vapours for their rain that near to them our sight approaches not	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0031.flac	as soon as ever of my second age i was upon the threshold and changed life himself from me he took and gave to others	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0032.flac	so low he fell that all appliances for his salvation were already short save showing him the people of perdition	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0033.flac	confusion and dismay together mingled forced such a yes from out my mouth that sight was needful to the understanding of it	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0034.flac	whence she to me in those desires of mine which led thee to the loving of that good beyond which there is nothing to aspire to	84
dev-clean/84/121550/84-121550-0035.flac	and what allurements or what vantages upon the forehead of the others showed that thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them	84
dev-clean/8842/302196/8842-302196-0000.flac	he translated at an early age chiefly between eighteen forty five and eighteen forty nine a great number of poems by the italians contemporary with dante or preceding him and among other things he made a version of the whole vita nuova prose and verse	8842
dev-clean/8842/302196/8842-302196-0001.flac	this book in its original form was received with favour and settled the claim of rossetti to rank as a poetic translator or indeed as a poet in his own right	8842
dev-clean/8842/302196/8842-302196-0002.flac	the life blood of rhythmical translation is this commandment that a good poem shall not be turned into a bad one	8842
dev-clean/8842/302196/8842-302196-0003.flac	the only true motive for putting poetry into a fresh language must be to endow a fresh nation as far as possible with one more possession of beauty	8842
dev-clean/8842/302196/8842-302196-0004.flac	poetry not being an exact science literality of rendering is altogether secondary to this chief law	8842
dev-clean/8842/302196/8842-302196-0005.flac	often would he avail himself of any special grace of his own idiom and epoch if only his will belonged to him often would some cadence serve him but for his authors structure some structure but for his authors cadence often the beautiful turn of a stanza must be weakened to adopt some rhyme which will tally and he sees the poet revelling in abundance of language where himself is scantily supplied	8842
dev-clean/8842/302196/8842-302196-0006.flac	and if you have time it would be a great service to translate the analyses of the poems which i omitted	8842
dev-clean/8842/302196/8842-302196-0007.flac	on january twenty fifth he wrote many and many thanks for a most essential service most thoroughly performed	8842
dev-clean/8842/302196/8842-302196-0008.flac	my notes which you have taken the trouble of revising are of course quite paltry and useless	8842
dev-clean/8842/302196/8842-302196-0009.flac	it is therefore and on all accounts unnecessary to say much more of the work here than it says for itself	8842
dev-clean/8842/302196/8842-302196-0010.flac	throughout the vita nuova there is a strain like the first falling murmur which reaches the ear in some remote meadow and prepares us to look upon the sea	8842
dev-clean/8842/302196/8842-302196-0011.flac	a word should be said here of the title of dantes autobiography	8842
dev-clean/8842/302196/8842-302196-0012.flac	this has induced some editors of the vita nuova to explain the title as meaning early life	8842
dev-clean/8842/302201/8842-302201-0000.flac	thereafter this sonnet bred in me desire to write down in verse four other things touching my condition the which things it seemed to me that i had not yet made manifest	8842
dev-clean/8842/302201/8842-302201-0001.flac	which thing being thus there came a day when certain ladies to whom it was well known they having been with me at divers times in my trouble were met together for the pleasure of gentle company	8842
dev-clean/8842/302201/8842-302201-0002.flac	but when i still spake not one of them who before had been talking with another addressed me by my name saying to what end lovest thou this lady seeing that thou canst not support her presence	8842
dev-clean/8842/302201/8842-302201-0003.flac	and now that it hath pleased her to deny me this love my master of his great goodness hath placed all my beatitude there where my hope will not fail me	8842
dev-clean/8842/302201/8842-302201-0004.flac	then those ladies began to talk closely together and as i have seen snow fall among the rain so was their talk mingled with sighs	8842
dev-clean/8842/302201/8842-302201-0005.flac	and i declare that when i speak thereof love sheds such perfect sweetness over me that if my courage failed not certainly to him my listeners must be all resignd	8842
dev-clean/8842/302201/8842-302201-0006.flac	whatever her sweet eyes are turned upon spirits of love do issue thence in flame which through their eyes who then may look on them pierce to the hearts deep chamber every one	8842
dev-clean/8842/302201/8842-302201-0007.flac	to her i wend along in whose much strength my weakness is made strong	8842
dev-clean/8842/302201/8842-302201-0008.flac	so to the road thou shalt be reconciled and find the lady and with the lady love	8842
dev-clean/8842/302201/8842-302201-0009.flac	the second begins here an angel the third here dear song i know	8842
dev-clean/8842/302201/8842-302201-0010.flac	the first part is divided into four	8842
dev-clean/8842/302201/8842-302201-0011.flac	in the third i say what it is i purpose to speak so as not to be impeded by faintheartedness	8842
dev-clean/8842/302201/8842-302201-0012.flac	in the fourth repeating to whom i purpose speaking i tell the reason why i speak to them	8842
dev-clean/8842/302201/8842-302201-0013.flac	in the second i tell what is understood of her on earth here my lady is desired	8842
dev-clean/8842/302201/8842-302201-0014.flac	this second part is divided into two for in the first i speak of her as regards the nobleness of her soul relating some of her virtues proceeding from her soul in the second i speak of her as regards the nobleness of her body narrating some of her beauties here love saith concerning her	8842
dev-clean/8842/302201/8842-302201-0015.flac	this second part is divided into two for in the one i speak of the eyes which are the beginning of love in the second i speak of the mouth which is the end of love	8842
dev-clean/8842/302203/8842-302203-0000.flac	and at the first it seemed to me that i saw certain faces of women with their hair loosened which called out to me thou shalt surely die after the which other terrible and unknown appearances said unto me thou art dead	8842
dev-clean/8842/302203/8842-302203-0001.flac	and so strong was my phantasy that i wept again in very truth and said with my true voice o excellent soul how blessed is he that now looketh upon thee	8842
dev-clean/8842/302203/8842-302203-0002.flac	whereby other ladies who were about the room becoming aware of my discomfort by reason of the moan that she made who indeed was of my very near kindred led her away from where i was and then set themselves to awaken me thinking that i dreamed and saying sleep no longer and be not disquieted	8842
dev-clean/8842/302203/8842-302203-0003.flac	when being aroused i opened mine eyes and knew that it had been a deception	8842
dev-clean/8842/302203/8842-302203-0004.flac	and my hue was such that they lookd at each other and thought of death saying under their breath most tenderly o let us comfort him then unto me what dream was thine that it hath shaken thee so much	8842
dev-clean/8842/302203/8842-302203-0005.flac	and therewithal such a bewilderment possessd me that i shut mine eyes for peace and in my brain did cease order of thought and every healthful thing	8842
dev-clean/8842/302203/8842-302203-0006.flac	then saw i many broken hinted sights in the uncertain state i steppd into	8842
dev-clean/8842/302203/8842-302203-0007.flac	these wildering phantasies then carried me to see my lady dead	8842
dev-clean/8842/302203/8842-302203-0008.flac	the second part begins here i was a thinking the first part divides into two	8842
dev-clean/8842/302203/8842-302203-0009.flac	this ladys right name was joan but because of her comeliness or at least it was so imagined she was called of many primavera spring and went by that name among them	8842
dev-clean/8842/302203/8842-302203-0010.flac	and in his speech he laughd and laughd again then while it was his pleasure to remain i chanced to look the way he had drawn near and saw the ladies joan and beatrice approach me this the other following one and a second marvel instantly	8842
dev-clean/8842/302203/8842-302203-0011.flac	the second part begins here saying be now the third here then while it was his pleasure	8842

dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0015.flac	i whispered to myself what blasphemy	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0016.flac	then taking heart i told my guide how more than once i had felt apollos radiant presence in my heart and told him of the immortal lines of homer concerning the divine apollo	116

dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0020.flac	he is a god and the son of a god	116

dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0028.flac	will he not speak to his worshippers i asked again	116

dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0030.flac	i asked my eyes filled with wonder and my voice quivering with excitement	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0031.flac	would not that then i ventured to ask impatiently make jesus as much of an idol as apollo	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0032.flac	and if faith that jesus is a god proves him a god why will not faith in apollo make him a god	116

dev-other/116/288046/116-288046-0001.flac	but there is more of a moral tonic in the open and candid discussion of a subject like the one in hand than in a multitude of platitudes	116

dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0000.flac	a number of other dates were observed by the christian church at various times as the birthday of jesus the gospels give no date and appear to be quite uncertain really ignorant about it	116

dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0029.flac	the same which the preachers of today give he parried his answer with many words and at length said that the promise was to be taken with the provision that what we asked for would be given if god thought it for our good	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0030.flac	but he said if ye ask anything in my name i will do it and if it were not so i would have told you	116

dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0000.flac	it was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing any great sense of incongruity when with impressible persons love becomes solicitousness hope sinks to misgiving and faith to hope when the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret at opportunities for ambition that have been passed by and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0001.flac	still to a close observer they are just as perceptible the difference is that their media of manifestation are less trite and familiar than such well known ones as the bursting of the buds or the fall of the leaf	1255

dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0012.flac	then a morsel of snow flew across the river towards the fifth window	1255

dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0015.flac	then a noise was heard apparently produced by the opening of the window	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0016.flac	said the blurred spot in the snow tremulously	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0017.flac	i asked which was your window forgive me	1255

dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0024.flac	good night frank good night	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0000.flac	things arrange themselves	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0001.flac	but the countess never gave way an inch	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0002.flac	the following was the answer which she returned to the note written to her by aunt julia	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0003.flac	i should not know how to drink wine with them and should do a hundred things which would make them think me a beast	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0004.flac	but the girl begged for some delay	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0005.flac	it was a matter that required to be considered	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0006.flac	pride in him might be as weak as pride in them	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0007.flac	if they would put out their hands to him why should he refuse to put out his own	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0008.flac	our tailor received him courteously having learned to like the man understanding that he had behaved with honesty and wisdom in regard to his client and respecting him as one of the workers of the day but he declared that for the lovel family as a family he did not care for them particularly	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0009.flac	they are poles asunder from me he said	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0010.flac	but by your good fortune and merit if you will allow me to say so you have travelled from the one pole very far towards the other	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0011.flac	at present i think that the sense of the country is in favour of an aristocracy of birth	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0012.flac	when you were foremost among them did you not wish to be their master	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0013.flac	it is one to which all legislative and all human efforts should and must tend	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0014.flac	when you make much water boil mister thwaite some of it will probably boil over	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0015.flac	i quite agree with you that the silk gowns should be kept for their elders and so the conversation was ended	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0016.flac	with her there was a real wish that the poles might be joined together by her future husband	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0017.flac	if you really wish it you shall go he said	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0018.flac	and a blue one to be married in alas me	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0019.flac	must i have a pink silk gown to walk about in early in the morning	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0020.flac	id sooner see you darning my worsted stockings sweetheart	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0021.flac	i can do that too	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0022.flac	and now ill sit down and write a letter to my lord	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0000.flac	he hoped nothing serious had happened to drag her out at such an untoward time	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0001.flac	but as the rain gave not the least sign of cessation he observed i think we shall have to go back never	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0002.flac	why not he inquired	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0003.flac	i cannot understand how you should know me while i have no knowledge of you	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0004.flac	oh but you know me about me at least	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0005.flac	i should think so	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0006.flac	hes my father indeed	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0007.flac	but we have been tenants of sylvania castle on the island here this season	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0008.flac	my fathers is a comparatively humble residence hard by	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0009.flac	but he could afford a much bigger one if he chose	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0010.flac	you have heard so	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0011.flac	i dont know he doesnt tell me much of his affairs	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0012.flac	my father she burst out suddenly is always scolding me for my extravagance	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0013.flac	was that this evening	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0014.flac	and there on the nets they sat	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0015.flac	jocelyn thought it strange that he should be thrown by fate into a position to play the son of the montagues to this daughter of the capulets	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0016.flac	no i shall go on and get a lodging in budmouth town if ever i reach it	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0017.flac	it is so late that there will be no house open except a little place near the station where you wont care to stay	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0018.flac	the island was an island still	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0019.flac	they had not realized the force of the elements till now	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0020.flac	he steadied her bodily by encircling her waist with his arm and she made no objection	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0021.flac	he pitied her and while he wondered at it admired her determination	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0022.flac	their application for admission led to the withdrawal of a bolt and they stood within the gaslight of the passage	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0023.flac	he could see now that though she was such a fine figure quite as tall as himself she was but in the bloom of young womanhood	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0024.flac	i will tell the servant to do this and send you up something to eat	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0025.flac	he felt ravenously hungry himself and set about drying his clothes as well as he could and eating at the same time	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0026.flac	by the aid of some temporary wraps and some slippers from the cupboard he was contriving to make himself comfortable when the maid servant came downstairs with a damp armful of womans raiment	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0027.flac	you are sleepy my girl said pierston	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0028.flac	he again became conscious of the change which had been initiated during the walk	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0029.flac	the well beloved was moving house had gone over to the wearer of this attire	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0030.flac	and how about little avice caro	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0000.flac	she draws close and satisfies	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0001.flac	he could not forget missus pine avons eyes though he remembered nothing of her other facial details	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0002.flac	afterwards they kept apart awhile in the drawing room for forms sake but eventually gravitated together again and finished the evening in each others company	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0003.flac	but this was not all	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0004.flac	but was he able	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0005.flac	it was unfair to go further without telling her even though hitherto such explicitness had not been absolutely demanded	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0006.flac	he determined to call immediately on the new incarnation	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0007.flac	she lived not far from the long fashionable hamptonshire square and he went thither with expectations of having a highly emotional time at least	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0008.flac	but somehow the very bell pull seemed cold although she had so earnestly asked him to come	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0009.flac	raising her eyes in a slightly inquiring manner from the book she was reading she leant back in the chair as if soaking herself in luxurious sensations which had nothing to do with him and replied to his greeting with a few commonplace words	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0010.flac	just as they turn madeira into port in the space of a single night so this old air has been taken and doctored and twisted about and brought out as a new popular ditty indeed	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0011.flac	she thawed a little and then they went on to talk about her house which had been newly painted and decorated with greenish blue satin up to the height of a persons head an arrangement that somewhat improved her slightly faded though still pretty face and was helped by the awnings over the windows	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0012.flac	yes i have had my house some years she observed complacently and i like it better every year	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0013.flac	dont you feel lonely in it sometimes o never	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0014.flac	what an uncivil thing to say she murmured in surprise	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0015.flac	it is rather uncivil	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0016.flac	as a punishment she did not ring the bell but left him to find his way out as he could	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0017.flac	i saw him at lady channelcliffes the other night	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0018.flac	jocelyn pierston	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0019.flac	o didnt he marry her	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0020.flac	said missus pine avon with a start	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0021.flac	but jocelyn was receding from the pretty widows house with long strides	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0022.flac	lady iris had left the drawing room for a moment to see that all was right in the dining room and when he was shown in there stood alone in the lamplight nichola pine avon	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0023.flac	she had been the first arrival	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0024.flac	as the other guests dropped in the pair retreated into a shady corner and she talked beside him till all moved off for the eating and drinking	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0025.flac	he had not been appointed to take her across to the dining room but at the table found her exactly opposite	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0026.flac	the spring in the present case was the artistic commendation she deserved and craved	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0027.flac	the lady on jocelyns left wife of a lord justice of appeal was in like manner talking to her companion on the outer side so that for the time he was left to himself	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0028.flac	it came from the wife of one of his fathers former workmen and was concerning her son whom she begged jocelyn to recommend as candidate for some post in town that she wished him to fill	1255
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0000.flac	what is necessary to the completeness of the story at this stage is not to recapitulate but to take up some of the loose ends of threads woven in and follow them through until the clear and comprehensive picture of events can be seen	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0001.flac	the way of the inventor is hard	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0002.flac	he can sometimes raise capital to help him in working out his crude conceptions but even then it is frequently done at a distressful cost of personal surrender	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0003.flac	when the result is achieved the invention makes its appeal on the score of economy of material or of effort and then labor often awaits with crushing and tyrannical spirit to smash the apparatus or forbid its very use	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0004.flac	possibly our national optimism as revealed in invention the seeking a higher good needs some check	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0005.flac	possibly the leaders would travel too fast and too far on the road to perfection if conservatism did not also play its salutary part in insisting that the procession move forward as a whole	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0006.flac	on the contrary the conditions for its acceptance had been ripening fast	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0007.flac	yet the very vogue of the electric arc light made harder the arrival of the incandescent	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0008.flac	a number of parent arc lighting companies were in existence and a great many local companies had been called into being under franchises for commercial business and to execute regular city contracts for street lighting	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0009.flac	thus in a curious manner the modern art of electric lighting was in a very true sense divided against itself with intense rivalries and jealousies which were none the less real because they were but temporary and occurred in a field where ultimate union of forces was inevitable	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0010.flac	hence twenty years after the first edison stations were established the methods they involved could be fairly credited with no less than sixty seven per cent	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0011.flac	it will be readily understood that under these conditions the modern lighting company supplies to its customers both incandescent and arc lighting frequently from the same dynamo electric machinery as a source of current and that the old feud as between the rival systems has died out	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0012.flac	in fact for some years past the presidents of the national electric light association have been chosen almost exclusively from among the managers of the great edison lighting companies in the leading cities	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0013.flac	the other strong opposition to the incandescent light came from the gas industry	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0014.flac	there also the most bitter feeling was shown	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0015.flac	the gas manager did not like the arc light but it interfered only with his street service which was not his largest source of income by any means	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0016.flac	here again was given a most convincing demonstration of the truth that such an addition to the resources of mankind always carries with it unsuspected benefits even for its enemies	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0017.flac	this was not long nor universally the spirit shown and to day in hundreds of cities the electric and gas properties are united under the one management which does not find it impossible to push in a friendly and progressive way the use of both illuminants	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0018.flac	the most conspicuous example of this identity of interest is given in new york itself	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0019.flac	so much for the early opposition of which there was plenty	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0020.flac	but it may be questioned whether inertia is not equally to be dreaded with active ill will	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0021.flac	of course a great many accounts were written and read but while genuine interest was aroused it was necessarily apathetic	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0022.flac	we got it at a great bargain and only paid a small sum down and the balance on mortgage	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0023.flac	we sold them for forty cents but there were only about twenty or thirty thousand of them	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0024.flac	the fourth year i got it down to thirty seven cents and i made all the money up in one year that i had lost previously	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0025.flac	one of the incidents which caused a very great cheapening was that when we started one of the important processes had to be done by experts	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0026.flac	after feeling around for some days i got a clew how to do it	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0027.flac	i then made another machine which did the work nicely	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0028.flac	incidentally it may be noted as illustrative of the problems brought to edison that while he had the factory at harrison an importer in the chinese trade went to him and wanted a dynamo to be run by hand power	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0029.flac	for making the dynamos edison secured as noted in the preceding chapter the roach iron works on goerck street new york and this was also equipped	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0030.flac	to sigmund bergmann who had worked previously with edison on telephone apparatus and phonographs and was already making edison specialties in a small way in a loft on wooster street new york was assigned the task of constructing sockets fixtures meters safety fuses and numerous other details	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0031.flac	in the early part of eighteen eighty one the edison electric light company leased the old bishop mansion at sixty five fifth avenue close to fourteenth street for its headquarters and show rooms	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0032.flac	this was one of the finest homes in the city of that period and its acquisition was a premonitory sign of the surrender of the famous residential avenue to commerce	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0033.flac	the experience with the little gas engine was rather startling	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0034.flac	one day it was not going very well and i went down to the man in charge and got exploring around	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0035.flac	for the next four or five years sixty five was a veritable beehive day and night	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0036.flac	the routine was very much the same as that at the laboratory in its utter neglect of the clock	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0037.flac	i was telling a gentleman one day that i could not keep a cigar even if i locked them up in my desk they would break it open	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0038.flac	he suggested to me that he had a friend over on eighth avenue who made a superior grade of cigars and who would show them a trick	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0039.flac	he said he would have some of them made up with hair and old paper and i could put them in without a word and see the result	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0040.flac	i thought no more about the matter	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0041.flac	i didnt remember anything about it	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0042.flac	i was too busy on other things to notice	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0043.flac	speaking of those days or nights edison says years ago one of the great violinists was remenyi	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0044.flac	he would talk with me but i never asked him to bring his violin	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0045.flac	one night he came with his violin about twelve oclock	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0046.flac	after that every time he came to new york he used to call at sixty five late at night with his violin	1585

dev-other/1585/157660/1585-157660-0007.flac	our first sight of sunrise in london gave us great expectations of fame and fortune for surely all we had was glowing expectations	1585

dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0000.flac	in my recent travels in the west i have felt that out there freedom as an idea has become feeble and ineffectual	1630
dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0001.flac	the same thing is happening now with the people of the west	1630
dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0002.flac	they are flattered into believing that they are free and they have the sovereign power in their hands	1630
dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0003.flac	thus it has become more and more evident to me that the ideal of freedom has grown tenuous in the atmosphere of the west	1630
dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0004.flac	the mentality is that of a slave owning community with a mutilated multitude of men tied to its commercial and political treadmill	1630

dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0010.flac	the organic unity of a varied and elastic society gave way to a conventional order which proved its artificial character by its inexorable law of exclusion	1630
dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0011.flac	life has its inequalities i admit but they are natural and are in harmony with our vital functions	1630
dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0012.flac	by squeezing human beings in the grip of an inelastic system and forcibly holding them fixed we have ignored the laws of life and growth	1630

dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0015.flac	they will be incapable of holding a just freedom in politics and of fighting in freedoms cause	1630
dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0016.flac	it represents the active aspect of inertia which has the appearance of freedom but not its truth and therefore gives rise to slavery both within its boundaries and outside	1630

dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0008.flac	we see light again since his serenity has been appointed your excellency said timokhin timidly and continually turning to glance at his colonel	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0009.flac	why so asked pierre	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0010.flac	then why was it forbidden	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0011.flac	at smolensk too he judged correctly that the french might outflank us as they had larger forces	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0012.flac	he ordered us to retreat and all our efforts and losses went for nothing	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0013.flac	so it has been with barclay	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0014.flac	while russia was well a foreigner could serve her and be a splendid minister but as soon as she is in danger she needs one of her own kin	1650

dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0018.flac	pierre looked at him in surprise	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0019.flac	and yet they say that war is like a game of chess he remarked	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0020.flac	the relative strength of bodies of troops can never be known to anyone	1650

dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0035.flac	and so thinks timokhin and the whole army	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0036.flac	since they are my foes they cannot be my friends whatever may have been said at tilsit	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0037.flac	yes yes muttered pierre looking with shining eyes at prince andrew	1650

dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0041.flac	prince andrew who had thought it was all the same to him whether or not moscow was taken as smolensk had been was suddenly checked in his speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0042.flac	he paced up and down a few times in silence but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips quivered as he began speaking	1650

dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0047.flac	i see that i have begun to understand too much	1650

dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0055.flac	on one of them he dwelt long and joyfully	1650
dev-other/1650/173551/1650-173551-0000.flac	his major domo came in a second time to say that the frenchman who had brought the letter from the countess was very anxious to see him if only for a minute and that someone from bazdeevs widow had called to ask pierre to take charge of her husbands books as she herself was leaving for the country	1650
dev-other/1650/173551/1650-173551-0001.flac	there was no one in the passage	1650
dev-other/1650/173551/1650-173551-0002.flac	the hall porter was standing at the front door	1650
dev-other/1650/173551/1650-173551-0003.flac	from the landing where pierre stood there was a second staircase leading to the back entrance	1650
dev-other/1650/173551/1650-173551-0004.flac	he went down that staircase and out into the yard no one had seen him	1650
dev-other/1650/173551/1650-173551-0005.flac	when he felt he was being looked at he behaved like an ostrich which hides its head in a bush in order not to be seen he hung his head and quickening his pace went down the street	1650

dev-other/1650/173551/1650-173551-0008.flac	he sat down at the dusty writing table and having laid the manuscripts before him opened them out closed them finally pushed them away and resting his head on his hand sank into meditation	1650
dev-other/1650/173551/1650-173551-0009.flac	makar alexeevich came twice that evening shuffling along in his galoshes as far as the door and stopped and looked ingratiatingly at pierre	1650

dev-other/1651/136854/1651-136854-0029.flac	no thirty two on patience even under extreme misery is wonderfully lofty and as much above the rant of stoicism as the sun of revelation is brighter than the twilight of pagan philosophy	1651
dev-other/1651/136854/1651-136854-0030.flac	it must indeed be allowed that the structure of his sentences is expanded and often has somewhat of the inversion of latin and that he delighted to express familiar thoughts in philosophical language being in this the reverse of socrates who it was said reduced philosophy to the simplicity of common life	1651
dev-other/1651/136854/1651-136854-0031.flac	this idle charge has been echoed from one babbler to another who have confounded johnsons essays with johnsons dictionary and because he thought it right in a lexicon of our language to collect many words which had fallen into disuse but were supported by great authorities it has been imagined that all of these have been interwoven into his own compositions	1651

dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0003.flac	here was she disturbed and unhappy because her instinct had made anything but a refusal impossible while he not many minutes after he had met with a rejection of what ought to have been the deepest holiest proposal of his life could speak as if briefs success and all its superficial consequences of a good house clever and agreeable society were the sole avowed objects of his desires oh dear	1686
dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0004.flac	her mother came into the room before this whirl of thoughts was adjusted into anything like order	1686

dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0012.flac	but she soon felt it was not about anything which having only lately and suddenly occurred could have given rise to any complicated thoughts that her father wished to speak to her	1686
dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0013.flac	mister hale did not answer for a minute or two	1686

dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0016.flac	because i must no longer be a minister in the church of england	1686
dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0017.flac	but nothing to the shock she received from mister hales last speech what could he mean	1686
dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0018.flac	it was all the worse for being so mysterious	1686
dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0019.flac	why can you no longer be a clergyman	1686
dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0020.flac	surely if the bishop were told all we know about frederick and the hard unjust	1686

dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0024.flac	no not doubts as to religion not the slightest injury to that he paused	1686
dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0025.flac	margaret sighed as if standing on the verge of some new horror	1686

dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0028.flac	he looked intently and inquiringly into his friends eyes evidently trying in vain to find the answer to some question	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0029.flac	would you believe it count i was not at all alarmed because i knew i was right	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0030.flac	i came forward berg stood up and showed how he presented himself with his hand to his cap and really it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and self complacency than his did	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0031.flac	well he stormed at me as the saying is stormed and stormed and stormed	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0032.flac	it was not a matter of life but rather of death as the saying is	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0033.flac	albanians and devils and to siberia said berg with a sagacious smile	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0034.flac	still i remained silent and what do you think count	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0035.flac	the next day it was not even mentioned in the orders of the day	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0036.flac	thats the way count said berg lighting his pipe and emitting rings of smoke	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0037.flac	yes that was fine said rostov smiling	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0038.flac	rostov was a truthful young man and would on no account have told a deliberate lie	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0039.flac	he began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened but imperceptibly involuntarily and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0040.flac	prince andrew who liked to help young men was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed toward boris who had managed to please him the day before he wished to do what the young man wanted	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0041.flac	in spite of prince andrews disagreeable ironical tone in spite of the contempt with which rostov from his fighting army point of view regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently one rostov felt confused blushed and became silent	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0042.flac	boris inquired what news there might be on the staff and what without indiscretion one might ask about our plans	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0043.flac	we shall probably advance replied bolkonski evidently reluctant to say more in the presence of a stranger	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0044.flac	berg took the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as was rumored the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0045.flac	i was there said rostov angrily as if intending to insult the aide de camp	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0046.flac	with a slightly contemptuous smile he said yes there are many stories now told about that affair	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0047.flac	but our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemys fire	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0048.flac	our stories have some weight not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0049.flac	however he added rising you know my name and where to find me but dont forget that i do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted and as a man older than you my advice is to let the matter drop	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0050.flac	exclaimed prince andrew and with a bow to them both he went out	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0051.flac	and he was still more angry at having omitted to say it	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0052.flac	he ordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave of boris rode home	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0053.flac	should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected adjutant or really let the matter drop was the question that worried him all the way	1701
dev-other/2506/11267/2506-11267-0000.flac	i see shoals of them depart not perhaps without an innate longing too to quit the island along with those happy snobs	2506

dev-other/2506/11267/2506-11267-0002.flac	i went to day to see our excellent friend snooks on board the queen of the french many scores of snobs were there on the deck of that fine ship marching forth in their pride and bravery	2506
dev-other/2506/11267/2506-11267-0003.flac	they will be at ostend in four hours they will inundate the continent next week they will carry into far lands the famous image of the british snob	2506
dev-other/2506/11267/2506-11267-0004.flac	i have seen snobs in pink coats and hunting boots scouring over the campagna of rome and have heard their oaths and their well known slang in the galleries of the vatican and under the shadowy arches of the colosseum	2506
dev-other/2506/11267/2506-11267-0005.flac	my lady marchioness comes on board looks round with that happy air of mingled terror and impertinence which distinguishes her ladyship and rushes to her carriage for it is impossible that she should mingle with the other snobs on deck	2506
dev-other/2506/11267/2506-11267-0006.flac	there she sits and will be ill in private	2506
dev-other/2506/11267/2506-11267-0007.flac	the strawberry leaves on her chariot panels are engraved on her ladyships heart	2506

dev-other/2506/11267/2506-11267-0010.flac	what a noble air of blazing contentment illuminates the features of those snobs of eastern race	2506
dev-other/2506/11267/2506-11267-0011.flac	what a toilette houndsditchs is	2506
dev-other/2506/11267/2506-11267-0012.flac	he will never spare himself any cheap enjoyment	2506
dev-other/2506/11267/2506-11267-0013.flac	i have said before i like to look at the peoples on their gala days they are so picturesquely and outrageously splendid and happy	2506
dev-other/2506/11267/2506-11267-0014.flac	yonder comes captain bull spick and span tight and trim who travels for four or six months every year of his life who does not commit himself by luxury of raiment or insolence of demeanour but i think is as great a snob as any man on board	2506
dev-other/2506/11267/2506-11267-0015.flac	bull passes the season in london sponging for dinners and sleeping in a garret near his club	2506

dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0000.flac	when a gross instance of snobbishness happens why should not the indignant journalist call the public attention to that delinquency too	2506
dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0001.flac	how for instance could that wonderful case of the earl of mangelwurzel and his brother be examined in the snobbish point of view	2506
dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0002.flac	all we require is that a man should be recommended to us by the earl of mangelwurzelshire	2506

dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0005.flac	it was her snobbish sentiment that misled her and made her vanities a prey to the swindling fortune teller	2506
dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0006.flac	how would you account for the prodigious benevolence exercised towards the interesting young french lady	2506
dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0007.flac	the honest boarding house people were at her feet at once	2506
dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0008.flac	good honest simple lord loving children of snobland	2506
dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0009.flac	finally there was the case of the right honourable mister vernon at york	2506
dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0010.flac	the right honourable was the son of a nobleman and practised on an old lady	2506
dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0011.flac	then he cast his nets over a family of father mother and daughters one of whom he proposed to marry	2506
dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0012.flac	one day the traitor fled with a teapot and a basketful of cold victuals	2506
dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0013.flac	it was the right honourable which baited the hook which gorged all these greedy simple snobs	2506
dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0014.flac	would they have been taken in by a commoner	2506
dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0015.flac	alas and alas what mortal man that speaks the truth can hope for such a landlady	2506

dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0021.flac	we never write on perfumed paper in short i cant help thinking that if you knew us you would not think us snobs	2506

dev-other/2506/169427/2506-169427-0000.flac	interest however still runs on in both cases the periodical or accidental payments of it just serving to keep the memory of the affair alive till at length in some evil hour pop comes the creditor upon each and by demanding principal upon the spot together with full interest to the very day makes them both feel the full extent of their obligations	2506
dev-other/2506/169427/2506-169427-0001.flac	as the reader for i hate your ifs has a thorough knowledge of human nature i need not say more to satisfy him that my hero could not go on at this rate without some slight experience of these incidental mementos	2506
dev-other/2506/169427/2506-169427-0002.flac	to speak the truth he had wantonly involved himself in a multitude of small book debts of this stamp which notwithstanding eugeniuss frequent advice he too much disregarded thinking that as not one of them was contracted thro any malignancy but on the contrary from an honesty of mind and a mere jocundity of humour they would all of them be crossd out in course	2506
dev-other/2506/169427/2506-169427-0003.flac	eugenius would never admit this and would often tell him that one day or other he would certainly be reckoned with and he would often add in an accent of sorrowful apprehension to the uttermost mite	2506
dev-other/2506/169427/2506-169427-0004.flac	what inclined eugenius to the same opinion was as follows	2506
dev-other/2506/169427/2506-169427-0005.flac	yorick followed eugenius with his eyes to the door he then closed them and never opened them more	2506
dev-other/2506/169427/2506-169427-0006.flac	alas poor yorick	2506
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0000.flac	now this is how arthur hunted the stag	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0001.flac	and the last dog that was let loose was the favorite dog of arthur cavall was his name	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0002.flac	then they sounded the death horn for slaying and they all gathered round	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0003.flac	one wished that it should be given to the lady best beloved by him and another to the lady whom he loved best	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0004.flac	and after midday they beheld an unshapely little man upon a horse and after him a dame or a damsel also on horseback and after her a knight of large stature bowed down and hanging his head low and sorrowfully and clad in broken and worthless armor	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0005.flac	i know not who they are said he but i know said guenever this is the knight whom geraint pursued and methinks that he comes not here by his own free will	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0006.flac	but geraint has overtaken him and avenged the insult to the maiden to the uttermost	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0007.flac	lady said he at the gate there is a knight and i saw never a man of so pitiful an aspect to look upon as he	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0008.flac	i do said he he tells me that he is edeyrn the son of nudd	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0009.flac	then she replied i know him not	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0010.flac	so guenever went to the gate to meet him and he entered	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0011.flac	and geraint greets thee well and in greeting thee he compelled me to come hither to do thy pleasure for the insult which thy maiden received from the dwarf now where did he overtake thee	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0012.flac	sir said she when thinkest thou that geraint will be here	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0013.flac	to morrow lady i think he will be here with the maiden	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0014.flac	i am lord said he and i have met with much trouble and received wounds unsupportable	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0015.flac	well said arthur from what i hear it behooves guenever to be merciful towards thee	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0016.flac	the mercy which thou desirest lord said she will i grant to him since it is as insulting to thee that an insult should be offered to me as to thyself	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0017.flac	thus will it be best to do said arthur let this man have medical care until it be known whether he may live	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0018.flac	to guenever and her handmaidens said he	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0019.flac	and the steward of the household so ordered her	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0020.flac	and being young he changed himself and grew to hate the sin that seemd so like his own of modred arthurs nephew and fell at last in the great battle fighting for the king	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0021.flac	and when geraint came to the place where guenever was he saluted her	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0022.flac	then they went in and dismounted	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0023.flac	heaven protect thee said arthur and the welcome of heaven be unto thee	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0024.flac	and inasmuch as thou hast vanquished edeyrn the son of nudd thou hast had a prosperous career	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0025.flac	and from that time she became his wife	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0026.flac	and the maiden took up her abode in the palace and she had many companions both men and women and there was no maiden more esteemed than she in the island of britain	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0027.flac	and a year and a second and a third he proceeded thus until his fame had flown over the face of the kingdom	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0028.flac	and he greets thee well as an uncle should greet his nephew and as a vassal should greet his lord	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0029.flac	and the neighboring chiefs knowing this grow insolent towards him and covet his land and possessions	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0030.flac	and arthur told geraint the cause of the mission and of the coming of the ambassadors to him out of cornwall truly said geraint be it to my advantage or disadvantage lord i will do according to thy will concerning this embassy	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0031.flac	what discourse said guenever do i hear between you	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0032.flac	said geraint i think i shall have enough of knighthood with me and they set forth	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0033.flac	and never was there seen a fairer host journeying towards the severn	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0034.flac	and he said to geraint i am a feeble and an aged man and whilst i was able to maintain the dominion for thee and for myself i did so	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0035.flac	and every one asked that which he desired	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0036.flac	and they were not long in giving so eager was every one to bestow gifts and of those who came to ask gifts none departed unsatisfied	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0037.flac	then geraint sent ambassadors to the men of cornwall to ask them this	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0038.flac	and they all said that it would be the fulness of joy and honor to them for geraint to come and receive their homage	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0039.flac	so he received the homage of such as were there	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0040.flac	and the day after the followers of arthur intended to go away	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0000.flac	geraint as he had been used to do when he was at arthurs court frequented tournaments	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0001.flac	before geraint the scourge of the enemy i saw steeds white with foam and after the shout of battle a fearful torrent	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0002.flac	these tidings came to erbin	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0003.flac	not i by my confession unto heaven said she there is nothing more hateful unto me than this	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0004.flac	and the tears she shed and the words she had spoken awoke him	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0005.flac	and evil betide me said he if thou returnest here until thou knowest whether i have lost my strength so completely as thou didst say	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0006.flac	then geraint went to see erbin	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0007.flac	sir said he i am going upon a quest and i am not certain when i may come back	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0008.flac	take heed therefore unto thy possessions until my return	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0009.flac	but one person only will go with me	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0010.flac	and he desired enid to mount her horse and to ride forward and to keep a long way before him	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0011.flac	and unless i speak unto thee say not thou one word either	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0012.flac	and though thou shouldst desire to see my defeat and my death by the hands of those men yet do i feel no dread	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0013.flac	and he received him and that not feebly	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0014.flac	and say not one word unto me unless i speak first unto thee	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0015.flac	i will do as far as i can lord said she according to thy desire	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0016.flac	ah maiden said he it is vain to attempt proceeding forward	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0017.flac	i cannot by any means refrain from sleep through weariness said he do thou therefore watch the horses and sleep not	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0018.flac	and when she saw the dawn of day appear she looked around her to see if he were waking and thereupon he woke	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0019.flac	and they left the wood and they came to an open country with meadows on one hand and mowers mowing the meadows	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0020.flac	my lord he added will it be displeasing to thee if i ask whence thou comest also	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0021.flac	wilt thou follow my counsel said the youth and take thy meal from me	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0022.flac	what sort of meal he inquired	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0023.flac	then they washed and took their repast	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0024.flac	i go now lord said he to meet the knight and to conduct him to his lodging	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0025.flac	i will do lord said she as thou sayest	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0026.flac	and after they had eaten and drank geraint went to sleep and so did enid also	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0000.flac	the dates seem unimportant but throughout the period the officers and men of the ship have been unremittingly busy	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0001.flac	bowers attacked the ships stores surveyed relisted and restowed them saving very much space by unstowing numerous cases and stowing the contents in the lazarette	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0002.flac	without steam the leak can now be kept under with the hand pump by two daily efforts of a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0003.flac	as the ship was and in her present heavily laden condition it would certainly have taken three to four hours each day	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0004.flac	the large green tent was put up and proper supports made for it	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0005.flac	the engine room staff and andersons people on the engines scientists were stowing their laboratories the cook refitting his galley and so forth not a single spot but had its band of workers	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0006.flac	the mens space such as it is therefore extends from the fore hatch to the stem on the main deck	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0007.flac	under the forecastle are stalls for fifteen ponies the maximum the space would hold the narrow irregular space in front is packed tight with fodder	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0008.flac	immediately behind the forecastle bulkhead is the small booby hatch the only entrance to the mens mess deck in bad weather	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0009.flac	abaft the fore hatch is the ice house	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0010.flac	we managed to get three tons of ice one hundred sixty two carcases of mutton and three carcases of beef besides some boxes of sweetbreads and kidneys into this space	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0011.flac	the sacks containing this last added to the goods already mentioned make a really heavy deck cargo and one is naturally anxious concerning it but everything that can be done by lashing and securing has been done	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0012.flac	forage i originally ordered thirty tons of compressed oaten hay from melbourne	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0013.flac	the scene is wholly enchanting and such a view from some sheltered sunny corner in a garden which blazes with masses of red and golden flowers tends to feelings of inexpressible satisfaction with all things	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0014.flac	a great mass of people assembled	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0015.flac	k and i lunched with a party in the new zealand companys ship ruapehu	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0016.flac	telegram to say terra nova had arrived sunday night	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0017.flac	a third sledge stands across the break of the poop in the space hitherto occupied by the after winch	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0018.flac	the quantity is two and a half tons and the space occupied considerable	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0019.flac	the ship was over two feet by the stern but this will soon be remedied	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0020.flac	they must perforce be chained up and they are given what shelter is afforded on deck but their position is not enviable	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0021.flac	it is a pathetic attitude deeply significant of cold and misery occasionally some poor beast emits a long pathetic whine	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0022.flac	there are generally one or two on watch which eases matters but it is a squash	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0023.flac	later in the day the wind has veered to the westward heading us slightly	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0024.flac	oates and atkinson with intermittent assistance from others were busy keeping the ponies on their legs	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0025.flac	there was nothing for it but to grapple with the evil and nearly all hands were labouring for hours in the waist of the ship heaving coal sacks overboard and re lashing the petrol cases et cetera in the best manner possible under such difficult and dangerous circumstances	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0026.flac	no sooner was some semblance of order restored than some exceptionally heavy wave would tear away the lashing and the work had to be done all over again	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0027.flac	from this moment about four a m the engine room became the centre of interest	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0028.flac	the water gained in spite of every effort	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0029.flac	the outlook appeared grim	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0030.flac	the amount of water which was being made with the ship so roughly handled was most uncertain	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0031.flac	williams had to confess he was beaten and must draw fires what was to be done	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0032.flac	the bilge pump is dependent on the main engine	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0033.flac	on one occasion i was waist deep when standing on the rail of the poop	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0034.flac	the afterguard were organised in two parties by evans to work buckets the men were kept steadily going on the choked hand pumps this seemed all that could be done for the moment and what a measure to count as the sole safeguard of the ship from sinking practically an attempt to bale her out	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0035.flac	occasionally a heavy sea would bear one of them away and he was only saved by his chain	3660
dev-other/3663/172005/3663-172005-0000.flac	the fawn had taken his morning meal and now lay curled up on a bed of moss	3663
dev-other/3663/172005/3663-172005-0001.flac	whenever the fawn caught up he was quite content to frisk about	3663
dev-other/3663/172005/3663-172005-0002.flac	the danger was certain now it was near	3663
dev-other/3663/172005/3663-172005-0003.flac	the hounds had struck her trail where she turned and the fawn was safe	3663
dev-other/3663/172005/3663-172005-0004.flac	one was rowing the other had a gun in his hand what should she do	3663
dev-other/3663/172005/3663-172005-0005.flac	her tired legs could not propel the tired body rapidly	3663
dev-other/3663/172005/3663-172005-0006.flac	the doe saw the boat nearing her	3663
dev-other/3663/172005/3663-172005-0007.flac	in a moment more the boat was on her and the man at the oars had leaned over and caught her	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0000.flac	i was tormented by thirst but had abstained from drinking for many days according to the doctors orders	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0001.flac	that old man ceased to give so much annoyance yet sometimes he appeared to me in dreams	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0002.flac	felice had given them orders not to speak to me of this	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0003.flac	this maid had stolen from me certain little things of some importance and in her fear of being detected she would have been very glad if i had died	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0004.flac	accordingly she allowed me twice to take as much as i could of the water so that in good earnest i swallowed more than a flask full one i then covered myself and began to sweat and fell into a deep sleep	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0005.flac	they say that my poor friend was on the point of falling to the ground so grieved was he to hear this	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0006.flac	afterwards he took an ugly stick and began to beat the serving girl with all his might shouting out ah traitress you have killed him for me then	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0007.flac	she may indeed have saved my life so lend me a helping hand for i have sweated and be quick about it	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0008.flac	felice recovered his spirits dried and made me comfortable and i being conscious of a great improvement in my state began to reckon on recovery	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0009.flac	just then the other doctor bernardino put in his appearance who at the beginning of my illness had refused to bleed me	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0010.flac	maestro francesco that most able man exclaimed oh power of nature	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0011.flac	she knows what she requires and the physicians know nothing	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0012.flac	that simpleton maestro bernardino made answer saying if he had drunk another bottle he would have been cured upon the spot	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0013.flac	afterwards he turned to me and asked if i could have drunk more water	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0014.flac	i answered no because i had entirely quenched my thirst	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0015.flac	in like manner she was asking for what she wanted when the poor young man begged you to bleed him	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0016.flac	if you knew that his recovery depended upon his drinking two flasks of water why did you not say so before	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0017.flac	you might then have boasted of his cure	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0018.flac	at these words the wretched quack sulkily departed and never showed his face again	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0019.flac	the very evening i was taken with great precautions in a chair well wrapped up and protected from the cold	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0020.flac	do not permit him any irregularities for though he has escaped this time another disorder now would be the death of him	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0021.flac	then he turned to me and said my benvenuto be prudent commit no excesses and when you are quite recovered i beg you to make me a madonna with your own hand and i will always pay my devotions to it for your sake	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0022.flac	so i made my mind up and prepared to travel	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0023.flac	that day many friends came to see me among others pier landi who was the best and dearest friend i ever had	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0024.flac	next day there came a certain niccolo da monte aguto who was also a very great friend of mine	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0025.flac	i had harboured him in rome and provided for his costs while he had turned my whole house upside down for the man was subject to a species of dry scab which he was always in the habit of scratching with his hands	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0026.flac	meanwhile that able physician francesco da monte varchi attended to my cure with great skill	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0027.flac	there they seated me to wait until the duke went by	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0028.flac	many of my friends at court came up to greet me and expressed surprise that i had undergone the inconvenience of being carried in that way while so shattered by illness they said that i ought to have waited till i was well and then to have visited the duke	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0029.flac	at these words maestro agostino the dukes tailor made his way through all those gentlemen and said if that is all you want to know you shall know it at this very moment	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0030.flac	giorgio the painter whom i have mentioned happened just then to pass and maestro agostino exclaimed there is the man who accused you now you know yourself if it be true or not	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0031.flac	as fiercely as i could not being able to leave my seat i asked giorgio if it was true that he had accused me	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0032.flac	he denied that it was so and that he had ever said anything of the sort	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0033.flac	maestro agostino retorted you gallows bird	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0034.flac	dont you know that i know it for most certain	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0035.flac	giorgio made off as quickly as he could repeating that he had not accused me	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0036.flac	then after a short while the duke came by whereupon i had myself raised up before his excellency and he halted	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0037.flac	the duke gazed at me and marvelled i was still alive afterwards he bade me take heed to be an honest man and regain my health	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0038.flac	when i reached home niccolo da monte aguto came to visit me and told me that i had escaped one of the most dreadful perils in the world quite contrary to all his expectations for he had seen my ruin written with indelible ink now i must make haste to get well and afterwards take french leave because my jeopardy came from a quarter and a man who was able to destroy me	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0039.flac	i answered that i had done nothing to displease him but that he had injured me and told him all the affair about the mint	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0040.flac	he repeated get hence as quickly as you can and be of good courage for you will see your vengeance executed sooner than you expect	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0041.flac	i the best attention to my health gave pietro pagolo advice about stamping the coins and then went off upon my way to rome without saying a word to the duke or anybody else	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0042.flac	you want them to immortalise that ferocious tyrant	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0043.flac	you have never made anything so exquisite which proves you our inveterate foe and their devoted friend and yet the pope and he have had it twice in mind to hang you without any fault of yours	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0044.flac	it was firmly believed that duke alessandro was the son of pope clement	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0045.flac	messer francesco used also to say and swear by all his saints that if he could he would have robbed me of the dies for that medal	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0046.flac	i responded that he had done well to tell me so and that i would take such care of them that he should never see them more	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0047.flac	i now sent to florence to request lorenzino that he would send me the reverse of the medal	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0048.flac	niccolo da monte aguto to whom i had written wrote back saying that he had spoken to that mad melancholy philosopher lorenzino for it he had replied that he was thinking night and day of nothing else and that he would finish it as soon as he was able	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0049.flac	nevertheless i was not to set my hopes upon his reverse but i had better invent one out of my own head and when i had finished it i might bring it without hesitation to the duke for this would be to my advantage	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0050.flac	i composed the design of a reverse which seemed to me appropriate and pressed the work forward to my best ability	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0051.flac	this being so as he was a fellow of much humour we used often to laugh together about the great credit he had gained	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0052.flac	i therefore dismounted at once got my fowling piece ready and at a very long range brought two of them down with a single ball	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0053.flac	i never used to shoot with more than one ball and was usually able to hit my mark at two hundred cubits which cannot be done by other ways of loading	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0054.flac	i lifted my foot and let the water run out then when i had mounted we made haste for rome	3663
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0000.flac	we have succeeded in amassing two hundred ounces of silver enough i trust to erect a handsome bronze figure	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0001.flac	to be sure it seems a shame yet if i could steal the money this priest is boasting about i could live at ease for the rest of my days and so he began casting about how best he might compass his purpose	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0002.flac	but the priest far from guessing the drift of his comrades thoughts journeyed cheerfully on till they reached the town of kuana	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0003.flac	here there is an arm of the sea which is crossed in ferry boats that start as soon as some twenty or thirty passengers are gathered together and in one of these boats the two travellers embarked	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0004.flac	when the boatmen and passengers heard the splash and saw the priest struggling in the water they were afraid and made every effort to save him but the wind was fair and the boat running swiftly under the bellying sails so they were soon a few hundred yards off from the drowning man who sank before the boat could be turned to rescue him	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0005.flac	when he saw this the ronin feigned the utmost grief and dismay and said to his fellow passengers this priest whom we have just lost was my cousin he was going to kiyoto to visit the shrine of his patron and as i happened to have business there as well we settled to travel together	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0006.flac	now alas by this misfortune my cousin is dead and i am left alone	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0007.flac	he spoke so feelingly and wept so freely that the passengers believed his story and pitied and tried to comfort him	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0008.flac	then the ronin said to the boatmen	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0009.flac	what think you gentlemen added he turning to the other travellers	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0010.flac	they of course were only too glad to avoid any hindrance to their onward journey and all with one voice agreed to what the ronin had proposed and so the matter was settled	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0011.flac	when at length they reached the shore they left the boat and every man went his way but the ronin overjoyed in his heart took the wandering priests luggage and putting it with his own pursued his journey to kiyoto	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0012.flac	fortune favouring his speculations he began to amass great wealth and lived at his ease denying himself nothing and in course of time he married a wife who bore him a child	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0013.flac	since then all has gone well with me yet had i not been poor i had never turned assassin nor thief	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0014.flac	he would have fled into the house but the ghost stretched forth its withered arm and clutching the back of his neck scowled at him with a vindictive glare and a hideous ghastliness of mien so unspeakably awful that any ordinary man would have swooned with fear	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0015.flac	at length undone by such ceaseless vexation tokubei fell ill and kept muttering oh misery misery the wandering priest is coming to torture me	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0016.flac	now it chanced that the story reached the ears of a certain wandering priest who lodged in the next street	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0017.flac	and hiding his head under the coverlet he lay quivering all over	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0018.flac	three years ago at the kuana ferry you flung me into the water and well you remember it	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0019.flac	happily continued the priest i had learned to swim and to dive as a boy so i reached the shore and after wandering through many provinces succeeded in setting up a bronze figure to buddha thus fulfilling the wish of my heart	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0020.flac	on my journey homewards i took a lodging in the next street and there heard of your marvellous ailment	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0021.flac	thinking i could divine its cause i came to see you and am glad to find i was not mistaken	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0022.flac	and would it not ill become me to bear malice	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0023.flac	repent therefore and abandon your evil ways	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0024.flac	to see you do so i should esteem the height of happiness	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0025.flac	be of good cheer now and look me in the face and you will see that i am really a living man and no vengeful goblin come to torment you	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0026.flac	in a fit of madness i was tempted to kill and rob you	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0027.flac	fortune befriended me ever after but the richer i grew the more keenly i felt how wicked i had been and the more i foresaw that my victims vengeance would some day overtake me	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0028.flac	haunted by this thought i lost my nerve till one night i beheld your spirit and from that time forth fell ill	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0029.flac	but how you managed to escape and are still alive is more than i can understand	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0030.flac	a guilty man said the priest with a smile shudders at the rustling of the wind or the chattering of a storks beak a murderers conscience preys upon his mind till he sees what is not	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0000.flac	every well ordered japanese home of the old fashioned kind has its little shrine which is the centre of the religious life of the house	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0001.flac	she it is who sets the rice and wine before the ancestral tablets who lights the little lamp each night and who sees that at each feast day and anniversary season the proper food is prepared and set out for the household gods	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0002.flac	these must be kept carefully by the mother as a safeguard against the many evils that beset child life	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0003.flac	visits to noted temples by relatives and friends often result in additions to the childs collection	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0004.flac	all these are put together by the careful mother and preserved as jealously as queen althea kept the charred stick that governed the destiny of her son	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0005.flac	as the children arrive at years of discretion these treasures pass out of the mothers faithful keeping into the hands of their actual owners and they are usually kept stored away in some little used drawer or cabinet until death removes the necessity for any further safeguards over life	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0006.flac	each animal brings its own kind of good or bad luck into the hour day or year over which it presides and only a skillful balancer of pros and cons can read aright the combinations and understand what the luck of any particular hour in any particular day of any particular year will be	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0007.flac	for the greater events of family life the home prophecies are felt to be too uncertain and the services of the fortune teller must be called in	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0008.flac	no well managed family would think of building a new house without finding in what direction to face the front door	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0009.flac	after this matter has been settled and the house is fairly begun there are occasional crises in its construction upon which much depends	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0010.flac	of these the most important is the day when the roof is raised	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0011.flac	the house owner then decides whether the day set by the builder is a lucky one for himself and his family	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0012.flac	a present of money to each workman is also in order and will conduce to the rapid and faithful execution of the job in hand when at last the house is finished and carpenters and plasterers are ready to leave it the local firemen who have assisted all along in the building as unskilled laborers often ascend to the roof and from the ridge pole cast down cakes for which the children of the neighborhood scramble joyfully	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0013.flac	all come who can and those who cannot come send servants or provisions	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0014.flac	on the day after the death often in the evening the body must be placed in the cask shaped coffin that until recently was the style commonly in use in japan	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0015.flac	now among the wealthier classes the long coffin has superseded the small square or round one but the smaller expense connected with burial in the old way makes the survival of the old type a necessity for the majority of japanese	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0016.flac	at an appointed time all the relatives assemble in the death chamber and preparations are made for the bathing of the corpse	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0017.flac	there is no official ceremonial mourning of parents for their children nor does custom require them to perform any of the last rites or attend the funeral	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0018.flac	upon the younger brothers and sisters falls the duty of attending to all the last sad ministrations	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0019.flac	when the body has been washed it is dressed in white in silk habutai whenever the family can afford it	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0020.flac	the body to be placed in the coffin must be folded into a sitting posture the chin resting upon the knees the position of the mummies found in many aboriginal american tombs	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0021.flac	this difficult to us apparently impossible feat safely accomplished there are placed in the coffin a number of small things that the dead takes with him to the next world	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0022.flac	the single exception to this rule about metal is that small copper coins may be put in to fee the old hag who guards the bank of the river of death	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0023.flac	last of all the vacant spaces in the coffin are filled in with bags of tea	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0024.flac	so long as the coffin is in the house it must be watched over continually	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0025.flac	it is their duty to see that the incense burning before the coffin is never allowed to go out while the food for the dead is renewed at regular intervals by the mourners themselves	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0026.flac	there are few enlightened japanese who will defend the present system of cruelty to the afflicted or who do not long for some change but so great is the force of conservatism in this regard so haunting the fear that any change may indicate a lack of respect for the dead that reform advances slowly	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0027.flac	individual instances occur in which some of the worst features of these customs are modified	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0028.flac	a case in point is that of the late mister fukuzawa a man whose life was devoted to the advancement of his countrymen in modern ways and who in his death continued his teaching	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0029.flac	in his will he provided that his body was to be buried without washing in the clothing in which he died	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0030.flac	through this growing feeling and the unselfishness of maternal affection may come in time the release from these mournful ceremonies	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0031.flac	just before the procession starts a religious ceremony is held at the house which is attended by the friends of the deceased and which is substantially the same as that performed at the cemetery	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0032.flac	on the day of the burial great bunches of natural flowers are sent to the dead each bunch so large as to require the services of one man to carry it	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0033.flac	sometimes with the gift a man is sent to take part in the procession but if the giver feels too poor to hire a man this burden too falls upon the bereaved household for etiquette requires that all flowers sent be borne to the grave by uniformed coolies who march in the funeral train	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0034.flac	another favorite present at this time among buddhists is a cage of living birds to be borne to the grave and released thereon	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0035.flac	it seems more like a bridal than a burial	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0036.flac	during this period the spirit of the deceased is supposed to be still inhabiting the house and a tablet or shrine is set up in the death chamber before which food and flowers are renewed daily	3915
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0000.flac	he tarried at genishau a few days and came up to gardow where i then resided he was apparently without any business that would support him but he soon became acquainted with my son thomas with whom he hunted for a long time and made his home with him at my house winter came on and he continued his stay	4153
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0001.flac	the enraged husband well knowing that he should feel a blow if he waited to hear the order repeated instantly retreated and went down the river to his cattle	4153
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0002.flac	we protected the poor nanticoke woman and gave her victuals and allen sympathized with her in her misfortunes till spring when her husband came to her acknowledged his former errors and that he had abused her without a cause promised a reformation and she received him with every mark of a renewal of her affection	4153
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0003.flac	the indians were soon answered by the american officer that the wampum was cordially accepted and that a continuance of peace was ardently wished for	4153

dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0006.flac	nettles at length abandoned the chase went home and allen all in tatters came in	4153
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0007.flac	by running in the woods his clothing had become torn into rags so that he was in a suffering condition almost naked	4153
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0008.flac	allen made his trowsers himself and then built a raft on which he went down the river to his own place at mount morris	4153
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0009.flac	there an indian gave him some refreshment and a good gun with which he hastened on to little beards town where he found his squaw	4153
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0010.flac	not daring to risk himself at that place for fear of being given up he made her but a short visit and came immediately to gardow	4153
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0011.flac	the love of liberty however added to his natural swiftness gave him sufficient strength to make his escape to his former castle of safety	4153
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0012.flac	his pursuers came immediately to my house where they expected to have found him secreted and under my protection	4153
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0013.flac	still unsatisfied and doubting my veracity they advised my indian brother to use his influence to draw from me the secret of his concealment which they had an idea that i considered of great importance not only to him but to myself i persisted in my ignorance of his situation and finally they left me	4153
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0014.flac	he came to my house in the night and awoke me with the greatest caution fearing that some of his enemies might be watching to take him at a time when and in a place where it would be impossible for him to make his escape	4153
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0015.flac	at that time allen lay in a secret place in the gulph a short distance above my flats in a hole that he accidentally found in the rock near the river	4153
dev-other/4153/186222/4153-186222-0000.flac	theres little danger in this quarter im sure so i may as well be friends with the poor child	4153

dev-other/4153/186222/4153-186222-0002.flac	beth hesitated	4153
dev-other/4153/186222/4153-186222-0003.flac	the letter asking me to visit her was the first i have ever received from her	4153
dev-other/4153/186222/4153-186222-0004.flac	but since she asked me to visit her we judged she had softened and might wish to become friendly and so i accepted the invitation	4153
dev-other/4153/186222/4153-186222-0005.flac	surely two girls will have a better time in this lonely old place than one could have alone	4153

dev-other/4153/186222/4153-186222-0028.flac	why did you not invite kenneth to dinner jane the boy	4153
dev-other/4153/186222/4153-186222-0029.flac	he is constantly saying disagreeable things	4153
dev-other/4153/186222/4153-186222-0030.flac	very well said the lawyer quietly which of my nieces do you prefer	4153
dev-other/4153/186222/4153-186222-0031.flac	asked the old lady after a pause i cannot say on so short an acquaintance he answered with gravity which do you prefer jane	4153
dev-other/4153/186222/4153-186222-0032.flac	they are equally unsatisfactory she answered	4153
dev-other/4153/186222/4153-186222-0033.flac	i cannot imagine elmhurst belonging to either silas	4153
dev-other/4153/186222/4153-186222-0034.flac	i must see that other niece the one who defies me and refuses to answer my second letter	4153
dev-other/4153/186222/4153-186222-0035.flac	there would be a dozen heirs to fight for my money and dear old elmhurst would be sold to strangers she resumed with bitterness	4153
dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0000.flac	in one corner of the little room kenneth forbes squatted upon a bench with an empty pine box held carelessly in his lap	4153
dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0001.flac	while duncan worked the boy was busy with his pencil but neither had spoken for at least a half hour	4153
dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0002.flac	then riding slowly up the hedge bordered road his troubles once more assailed him and he wondered if there was not some spot upon the broad earth to which he could fly for retirement until the girls had left elmhurst for good	4153
dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0003.flac	nora shied and he looked up to discover that he had nearly run down a pedestrian a stout little man with a bundle under his arm who held up one hand as if to arrest him	4153
dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0004.flac	where do you want to go asked the boy	4153
dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0005.flac	then its the same jane as ever he responded with a shake of his grizzled head	4153
dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0006.flac	do you know i sort o hoped shed reformed and id be glad to see her again they tell me shes got money	4153

dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0009.flac	dont like girls i take it	4153
dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0010.flac	another long pause then the boy suddenly turned questioner	4153
dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0011.flac	you know aunt miss merrick sir	4153
dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0012.flac	i used to when we were both younger	4153
dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0013.flac	kenneth stopped short and the mare stopped and the little man with a whimsical smile at the boys astonishment also stopped	4153
dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0014.flac	john merrick thats me	4153
dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0015.flac	you were the tinsmith	4153
dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0016.flac	they kept track of her because she suddenly became rich and a great lady and that was a surprising thing to happen to a merrick	4153
dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0017.flac	thank you lad returned the man gratefully i thought a little exercise would do me good but this three miles has seemed like thirty to me	4153
dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0018.flac	i will said the man	4153
dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0019.flac	the boy turned away but in a moment halted again	4153
dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0020.flac	his interest in miss janes brother john was extraordinary	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0000.flac	they are but lukewarm lovers who can content themselves with a dialogue carried on at bowshot distance	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0001.flac	if there be an elysium on earth it is this	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0002.flac	his own daughter his only daughter of the best blood of southern aristocracy beautiful accomplished everything to secure him a splendid alliance holding nightly assignation with a horse hunter	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0003.flac	he could well concede so much to her caprice since her staying at home could be no disadvantage to the cause that had prompted him to the stern counsel	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0004.flac	it is already known that this road passed the hacienda of casa del corvo at some distance from the house and on the opposite side of the river	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0005.flac	on reaching the copse he dismounted led his horse in among the underwood hitched him by looping his bridle rein around the topmost twigs of an elastic bough then detaching a long rope of twisted horsehair from the horn of his saddle and inserting his arm into its coil he glided out to the edge of the island on that side that lay towards the hacienda	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0006.flac	before forsaking the shadow of the copse he cast a glance towards the sky and at the moon sailing supremely over it	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0007.flac	the droll conceit which has so oft amused the nocturnal inebriate of great cities appeared to produce a like affect upon the night patroller of the prairie and for a moment the shadow late darkening his brow disappeared	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0008.flac	its not likely at this hour unless it be the owner of a bad conscience who cant sleep	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0009.flac	troth theres one such within those walls	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0010.flac	if he be abroad theres a good chance of his seeing me on the open ground not that i should care a straw if it were only myself to be compromised	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0011.flac	its no use waiting upon the moon deuce take her	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0012.flac	it is true he had designs upon the hacienda but these did not contemplate either its cash plate or jewellery if we except the most precious jewel it contained the mistress of the mansion herself	4153
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0000.flac	the church bells were ringing and people on the avenue going by to service turned curious inquiring looks up at the great house and then went on talking of the recent events which had so strangely entered into and made history in the city	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0001.flac	and all through his impassioned appeal this morning there was a note of sadness and rebuke and stern condemnation that made many of the members pale with self accusation or with inward anger	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0002.flac	raymond had voted to continue for another year the saloon	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0003.flac	the christians of raymond stood condemned by the result	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0004.flac	for that had been the fact in raymond for years the saloon ruled	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0005.flac	president marsh sat there his usual erect handsome firm bright self confident bearing all gone his head bowed upon his breast the great tears rolling down his cheeks unmindful of the fact that never before had he shown outward emotion in a public service	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0006.flac	what if he had begun to do as jesus would have done long ago	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0007.flac	when had the first church yielded to such a baptism of tears	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0008.flac	what had become of its regular precise conventional order of service undisturbed by any vulgar emotion and unmoved by any foolish excitement	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0009.flac	they had been living so long on their surface feelings that they had almost forgotten the deeper wells of life	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0010.flac	the meeting was tender it glowed with the spirits presence it was alive with strong and lasting resolve to begin a war on the whiskey power in raymond that would break its reign forever	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0011.flac	since the first sunday when the first company of volunteers had pledged themselves to do as jesus would do the different meetings had been characterized by distinct impulses or impressions	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0012.flac	and all through it ran one general cry for deliverance from the saloon and its awful curse	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0013.flac	gray and his wife were besieged by inquirers who wanted to know what loreens friends and acquaintances were expected to do in paying their last respects to her	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0014.flac	gray had gone up to virginias and after talking it over with her and maxwell the arrangement had been made	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0015.flac	i am and always have been opposed to large public funerals said gray whose complete wholesome simplicity of character was one of its great sources of strength but the cry of the poor creatures who knew loreen is so earnest that i do not know how to refuse this desire to see her and pay her poor body some last little honor what do you think mister maxwell	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0016.flac	i will be guided by your judgment in the matter	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0017.flac	i am sure that whatever you and miss page think best will be right	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0018.flac	under the circumstances i have a great distaste for what seems like display at such times but this seems different	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0019.flac	it happened that that afternoon a somewhat noted newspaper correspondent was passing through raymond on his way to an editorial convention in a neighboring city	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0020.flac	she was a common street drunkard and yet the services at the tent were as impressive as any i ever witnessed in a metropolitan church over the most distinguished citizen	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0021.flac	it struck me of course being a stranger in the place with considerable astonishment to hear voices like those one naturally expects to hear only in great churches or concerts at such a meeting as this	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0022.flac	mister maxwell spoke of the fact that the dead woman had been fully prepared to go but he spoke in a peculiarly sensitive manner of the effect of the liquor business on the lives of men and women like this one	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0023.flac	raymond of course being a railroad town and the centre of the great packing interests for this region is full of saloons	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0024.flac	then followed what was perhaps the queer part of this strange service	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0025.flac	it was one of the simplest and at the same time one of the most impressive sights i ever witnessed	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0026.flac	there must have been a hundred of these women and i was told many of them had been converted at the meetings just recently	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0000.flac	there was no answer and after one or two ineffectual attempts phronsie turned fearfully away	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0001.flac	ill try and she laid a quick hand on the knob	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0002.flac	two red spots burned on her cheeks and her pale blue eyes snapped	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0003.flac	oh im sure i heard it raging up and down	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0004.flac	i dont want any dinner said charlotte drawing back	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0005.flac	yes indeed said polly cheerily just as fine as can be	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0006.flac	assuredly said old mister king with great satisfaction in pollys pleasure and at her success in drawing charlotte out	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0007.flac	and after this there were no more quiet days for charlotte chatterton	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0008.flac	oh bless me its you phronsie in pleased surprise	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0009.flac	yes grandpapa said phronsie coming in and shutting the door carefully i came on purpose to see you all alone	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0010.flac	so you did dear said mister king highly gratified and pushing away his writing table he held out his hand	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0011.flac	oh no grandpapa cried phronsie in a rapture i could never be too big for that so she perched up as of old on his knee then she folded her hands and looked gravely in his face	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0012.flac	well my dear what is it	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0013.flac	asked the old gentleman presently youve come to tell me something i suppose	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0014.flac	yes grandpapa i have said phronsie decidedly and it is most important too grandpapa and oh i do wish it so much and she clasped her hands tighter and sighed	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0015.flac	well then phronsie if you want it i suppose it must be said mister king quite as a matter of course	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0016.flac	oh she left you everything she had phronsie a couple of millions or so it is why	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0017.flac	charlotte poor repeated the old gentleman	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0018.flac	why no not exactly her father isnt rich but charlotte i think may do very well especially as i intend to keep her here for a while and then i shall never let her suffer phronsie never indeed	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0019.flac	grandpapa said phronsie wasnt missus chatterton aunt to charlotte	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0020.flac	if missus chatterton was aunt to charlotte persisted phronsie slowly it seems as if charlotte ought to have some of the money it really does grandpapa	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0021.flac	maybe said the old gentleman with a short laugh and i shouldnt wonder if cousin eunice was sorry over a few other things too phronsie	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0022.flac	wouldnt it make her very glad if i gave charlotte some of the money	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0023.flac	for answer mister king set her down hastily on the floor and took two or three turns up and down the room	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0024.flac	oh i do so wish i might she said theres so much for a little girl like me	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0025.flac	it would be so nice to have charlotte have some with me still no answer	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0026.flac	i was writing a note to missus fargo said phronsie putting up her lips for a kiss	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0027.flac	sure as i can be phronsie said old mister king smiling good by dear	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0028.flac	there there my sisters boy shall never say that but come in come in	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0029.flac	not to be ungracious the young man threw himself into a chair	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0030.flac	oh hang it uncle why cant you let me alone	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0031.flac	which is a wonder interpolated pickering	4323

dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0033.flac	for heavens sake pickering cried his uncle darting in front of the chair and its restless occupant dont say that again	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0034.flac	ive been a lazy dog all my life and a good for naught but i hope ive not sunk to that	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0000.flac	the next moment he fell back in amazement before the impetuous rush of a starry eyed flushed cheeked young woman who demanded	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0001.flac	where is he pete miss billy gasped the old man	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0002.flac	aunt hannahs cheeks too were flushed and her eyes starry but with dismay and anger the last because she did not like the way pete had said miss billys name	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0003.flac	it was one matter for her to object to this thing billy was doing but quite another for pete to do it of course its she	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0004.flac	retorted aunt hannah testily as if you yourself didnt bring her here with your crazy messages at this time of night pete where is he	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0005.flac	interposed billy tell mister bertram i am here or wait ill go right in and surprise him	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0006.flac	pete had recovered himself by now but he did not even glance toward aunt hannah	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0007.flac	miss billy miss billy youre an angel straight from heaven you are you are oh im so glad you came	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0008.flac	itll be all right now all right hes in the den miss billy	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0009.flac	billy turned eagerly but before she could take so much as one step toward the door at the end of the hall aunt hannahs indignant voice arrested her billy stop	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0010.flac	pete go tell your master that we are here and ask if he will receive us petes lips twitched	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0011.flac	but his face was preternaturally grave when he spoke	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0012.flac	a flying figure brushed by him and fell on its knees by the couch with a low cry bertrams eyes flew open	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0013.flac	dong ling found him there a minute later polishing a silver teaspoon with a fringed napkin that had been spread over bertrams tray	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0014.flac	in the hall above aunt hannah was crying into williams gray linen duster that hung on the hall rack aunt hannahs handkerchief was on the floor back at hillside	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0015.flac	then very gradually it dawned over them that there was after all something strange and unexplained in it all	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0016.flac	as if to make sure that she was here like this he drew her even closer bertram was so thankful that he did have one arm that was usable	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0017.flac	why of of course stammered billy i couldnt help thinking that maybe you had found out you didnt want me	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0018.flac	demanded bertram angry and mystified	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0019.flac	as for my not painting again you didnt understand pete dearie	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0020.flac	she pulled herself half away from bertrams encircling arm	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0021.flac	billy drew a quivering sigh	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0022.flac	good heavens is kate in this too bertrams voice was savage now	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0023.flac	well she wrote a letter	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0024.flac	billy laughed gayly but she shifted her position and did not meet her lovers eyes	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0025.flac	and you never did think for a minute billy that you cared for him	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0026.flac	he had not been slow to mark that swift lowering of her eyelids	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0027.flac	billy was so glad bertram had turned the question on her love instead of arkwrights	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0028.flac	after a minute billy stirred and sighed happily	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0029.flac	you see i wasnt in love with mister arkwright	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0030.flac	and and you didnt care specially for for miss winthrop	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0031.flac	billy put a soft finger on his lips	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0032.flac	bertram kissed the finger and subsided humph he commented	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0033.flac	well what is that is that kate too demanded bertram grimly	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0034.flac	there was another silence then suddenly bertram stirred	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0035.flac	billy im going to marry you to morrow he announced decisively	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0036.flac	i dont know as i can trust you out of my sight till then youll read something or hear something or get a letter from kate after breakfast to morrow morning that will set you saving me again and i dont want to be saved that way	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0037.flac	im going to marry you to morrow ill get he stopped short with a sudden frown confound that law i forgot	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0038.flac	five days indeed sir	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0039.flac	i wonder if you think i can get ready to be married in five days	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0040.flac	dont want you to get ready retorted bertram promptly i saw marie get ready and i had all i wanted of it	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0041.flac	if you really must have all those miles of tablecloths and napkins and doilies and lace rufflings well do it afterwards not before but	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0042.flac	besides i need you to take care of me cut in bertram craftily	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0043.flac	the tender glow on billys face told its own story and bertrams eager eyes were not slow to read it	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0044.flac	sweetheart see here dear he cried softly tightening his good left arm	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0045.flac	billy my dear	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0046.flac	it was aunt hannahs plaintive voice at the doorway a little later	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0047.flac	we must go home and william is here too and wants to see you	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0048.flac	you mean itll be before october	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0049.flac	aunt hannah glanced from one to the other uncertainly	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0050.flac	yes nodded billy demurely	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0051.flac	yes i know that is a good while cut in bertram airily	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0052.flac	we wanted it to morrow but we had to wait on account of the new license law	4323
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0000.flac	yet so strong was the effect upon him of contemplating a large fortune that in despite of reason and desire he lived in eager expectation of the word which should make him rich	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0001.flac	a part of that impression was due to the engagement which he must now fulfil	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0002.flac	to shuffle out of this duty would make him too ignoble even in his own eyes	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0003.flac	because in his salad days he dallied with a girl who had indeed many charms step by step he had come to the necessity of sacrificing his prospects to that raw attachment	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0004.flac	unable to think of work he left the house and wandered gloomily about regents park	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0005.flac	he felt himself ill used by destiny and therefore by marian who was fates instrument	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0006.flac	he wrote to marian	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0007.flac	will you let me hear or come and see me	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0008.flac	i scarcely thought of biffen as likely to kill himself	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0009.flac	but why the deuce did he go all the way out there	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0010.flac	i hoped you would bring me some news	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0011.flac	poverty i can only suppose	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0012.flac	but i will see whelpdale i hadnt come across biffen for a long time	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0013.flac	was he still so very poor	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0014.flac	asked amy compassionately	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0015.flac	im afraid so his book failed utterly	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0016.flac	oh if i had imagined him still in such distress surely i might have done something to help him	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0017.flac	perchance his death was in part attributable to that hopeless love	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0018.flac	he sent me a copy of his novel she said and i saw him once or twice after that	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0019.flac	having this subject to converse upon put the two more quickly at ease than could otherwise have been the case	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0020.flac	amy might take a foremost place among brilliant women	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0021.flac	especially now that her father is threatened with blindness	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0022.flac	is it so serious	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0023.flac	even if mister yule recovers his sight it is not at all likely that he will be able to work as before	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0024.flac	our difficulties are so grave that	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0025.flac	he paused and let his hand fail despondently	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0026.flac	i have a good deal of will you remember and what i have set my mind upon no doubt i shall some day achieve	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0027.flac	there was silence	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0028.flac	the last three years he continued have made no slight difference in my position	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0029.flac	recall where i stood when you first knew me	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0030.flac	just now i am in need of a little encouragement	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0031.flac	you dont notice any falling off in my work recently	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0032.flac	do you see my things in the current and so on generally	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0033.flac	sometimes i believe i have detected you when there was no signature	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0034.flac	her story in that girls paper has attracted attention	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0035.flac	and i could so easily put her at rest by renouncing all claim upon her	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0036.flac	i surmise that that you yourself would also be put at rest by such a decision	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0037.flac	dont look at me with that ironical smile he pleaded	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0038.flac	i couldnt go about declaring that i was heartbroken in any event i must be content for people to judge me according to their disposition and judgments are pretty sure to be unfavourable what can i do	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0039.flac	the case is too delicate i fear for my advice	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0040.flac	well ill go back to my scribbling	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0041.flac	again jasper held the white soft hand for a superfluous moment	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0042.flac	yet for such feelings he reproached himself and the reproach made him angry	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0043.flac	marian could not mistake the air of restless trouble on her companions smooth countenance	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0044.flac	she had divined that there was some grave reason for this summons and the panting with which she had approached was half caused by the anxious beats of her heart	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0045.flac	he began abruptly	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0046.flac	he gave her such details as he had obtained then added	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0047.flac	there are two of my companions fallen in the battle	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0048.flac	i ought to think myself a lucky fellow marian what	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0049.flac	you are better fitted to fight your way jasper	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0050.flac	more of a brute you mean	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0051.flac	you know very well i dont	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0052.flac	i have made up my mind about our affairs he went on presently	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0053.flac	yes	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0054.flac	will you marry me and let us take our chance	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0055.flac	you feel yourself indispensable to your father at present	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0056.flac	i should be so afraid of the effect upon his health jasper	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0057.flac	she paused and looked up at him touchingly	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0058.flac	dear i cant feel it would be my duty to renounce you because my father had become blind	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0059.flac	has one thing occurred to you	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0060.flac	will he consent to receive an allowance from a person whose name is missus milvain	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0061.flac	and if he obstinately refuses what then what is before him	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0062.flac	she listened anxiously and reflected	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0063.flac	as i have said there is the very serious doubt whether your father would accept money from you when you are my wife	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0064.flac	it isnt your fault marian and well then theres only one thing to do	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0065.flac	except jasper that if father is helpless i must find means of assuring his support	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0066.flac	do you think them insurmountable	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0067.flac	that is just what i have decided is impossible marian you shall have the plain truth	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0068.flac	i dont trust myself	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0069.flac	but shall you face them willingly	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0070.flac	put up your umbrella marian	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0071.flac	what do i care for a drop of rain she exclaimed with passionate sadness when all my life is at stake how am i to understand you	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0072.flac	every word you speak seems intended to dishearten me	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0073.flac	why need you conceal it if that is the truth	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0074.flac	is that what you mean by saying you distrust yourself	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0075.flac	we must see each other again marian	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0076.flac	how am i to live an hour in such uncertainty as this	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0077.flac	i do wish it	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0078.flac	her emotion had an effect upon him and his voice trembled	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0079.flac	there is no natural law that a child should surrender everything for her parents	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0080.flac	you know so much more of the world than i do cant you advise me	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0081.flac	is there no way of providing for my father	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0082.flac	good god this is frightful marian i cant stand it	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0083.flac	i will be faithful to you	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0084.flac	he had made a pretence of holding his umbrella over her but marian turned away and walked to a little distance and stood beneath the shelter of a great tree her face averted from him	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0085.flac	moving to follow he saw that her frame was shaken by soundless sobbing	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0086.flac	in what can there be more selfishness	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0087.flac	but i couldnt say a word that would seem to invite such misery as this	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0088.flac	you dont love me jasper and thats an end of everything	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0089.flac	happiness or misery come to us by fate	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0090.flac	is it in my power to make you happy	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0091.flac	but if you had said you loved me before that i should have it always to remember	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0092.flac	if i believe anything i believe that i did love you	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0093.flac	what can you say to me more than you have said now	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0094.flac	remember me as a man who disregarded priceless love such as yours to go and make himself a proud position among fools and knaves indeed thats what it comes to	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0095.flac	soon enough you would thoroughly despise me and though i should know it was merited my perverse pride would revolt against it	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0096.flac	what can be simpler than the truth	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0097.flac	it is a thing that happens every day either in man or woman and all that honour demands is the courage to confess the truth	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0098.flac	marian will you do this will you let our engagement last for another six months but without our meeting during that time	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0099.flac	that seems to me childish	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0100.flac	the rain fell unceasingly and with it began to mingle an autumnal mist	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0101.flac	jasper delayed a moment then asked calmly	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0102.flac	are you going to the museum yes	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0103.flac	go home again for this morning marian you cant work	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0104.flac	i must and i have no time to lose	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0105.flac	good bye she gave him her hand	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0106.flac	they looked at each other for an instant then marian left the shelter of the tree opened her umbrella and walked quickly away	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0107.flac	jasper did not watch her he had the face of a man who is suffering a severe humiliation	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0108.flac	his sister said very little for she recognised genuine suffering in his tones and aspect	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0109.flac	a few weeks ago he actually proposed to a woman for whom he does not pretend to have the slightest affection but who is very rich and who seemed likely to be foolish enough to marry him	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0110.flac	yesterday morning he received her final answer a refusal	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0111.flac	you will understand though surely you need no fresh proof how utterly unworthy he is of you	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0112.flac	you are the only friend i have of my own sex and i could not bear to lose you	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0113.flac	several days passed before there came a reply	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0114.flac	i must only ask that you will write to me without the least reference to these troubles tell me always about yourself and be sure that you cannot tell me too much	4515
dev-other/4570/102353/4570-102353-0000.flac	we had then but little of that minute and accurate knowledge of the interior of the continent which was requisite for a determination of the problem	4570
dev-other/4570/102353/4570-102353-0001.flac	several different parties were therefore organized to examine the various routes supposed to be practicable within the northern and southern limits of the united states	4570
dev-other/4570/102353/4570-102353-0002.flac	the only discrimination made was in the more prompt and thorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern line and this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficult of execution of all the surveys	4570
dev-other/4570/102353/4570-102353-0003.flac	inquiries were made with regard to gunpowder which subsequently led to the use of a coarser grain for artillery	4570
dev-other/4570/102353/4570-102353-0004.flac	the officers of these regiments were chosen partly by selection from those already in service in the regular army and partly by appointment from civil life	4570
dev-other/4570/102353/4570-102353-0005.flac	under instructions from the president the list was therefore revised and modified in accordance with this new element of geographical distribution	4570
dev-other/4570/102353/4570-102353-0006.flac	after some further discussion of the question the visitors withdrew dissatisfied with the result of the interview	4570
dev-other/4570/102353/4570-102353-0007.flac	the quartermaster general on hearing of this conversation hastened to inform me that it was all a mistake that the appointee to the office had been confounded with his father who was a well known whig but that he the son was a democrat	4570
dev-other/4570/102353/4570-102353-0008.flac	i assured the general that this was altogether immaterial adding that it was a very pretty quarrel as it stood and that i had no desire to effect a settlement of it on any inferior issue	4570
dev-other/4570/14911/4570-14911-0000.flac	nevertheless in general appearance the harrier and the foxhound are very much alike the one obvious distinction being that of size	4570
dev-other/4570/14911/4570-14911-0001.flac	if you want to hunt your harriers on foot sixteen inches is quite big enough almost too big to run with but if you are riding to them twenty inches is a useful height or even nineteen inches	4570
dev-other/4570/14911/4570-14911-0002.flac	it is useless to lay down any hard and fast rule as to colour it is so much a matter of individual taste	4570
dev-other/4570/14911/4570-14911-0003.flac	but puppies are usually sent out to walk and may easily be procured to be kept and reared until they are old enough to be entered to their work	4570
dev-other/4570/14911/4570-14911-0004.flac	he is of course finer but with the length of neck so perfect in the bigger hound the little shoulders of the same pattern and the typical quarters and second thighs	4570
dev-other/4570/14911/4570-14911-0005.flac	and when he is fairly on a line of course he sticks to it as the saying is like a beagle	4570
dev-other/4570/14911/4570-14911-0006.flac	it is quite possible therefore that the beagle was crossed with the welsh southern or otterhound to get more size and power as there certainly was a welsh rough coated beagle of good eighteen inches and an almost identical contemporary that was called the essex beagle	4570
dev-other/4570/14911/4570-14911-0007.flac	that a great many of the true order were bred became very manifest as soon as the harrier and beagle association was formed and more particularly when a section of the peterborough hound show was reserved for them	4570
dev-other/4570/14911/4570-14911-0008.flac	then they seemed to spring from every part of the country	4570

dev-other/4570/14911/4570-14911-0017.flac	height not exceeding sixteen inches	4570
dev-other/4570/24733/4570-24733-0000.flac	all things which follow from the absolute nature of any attribute of god must always exist and be infinite or in other words are eternal and infinite through the said attribute	4570
dev-other/4570/24733/4570-24733-0001.flac	proof conceive if it be possible supposing the proposition to be denied that something in some attribute of god can follow from the absolute nature of the said attribute and that at the same time it is finite and has a conditioned existence or duration for instance the idea of god expressed in the attribute thought	4570
dev-other/4570/24733/4570-24733-0002.flac	in its nature infinite	4570
dev-other/4570/24733/4570-24733-0003.flac	must necessarily exist	4570
dev-other/4570/24733/4570-24733-0004.flac	we have now granted therefore thought not constituting the idea of god and accordingly the idea of god does not naturally follow from its nature in so far as it is absolute thought for it is conceived as constituting and also as not constituting the idea of god which is against our hypothesis	4570
dev-other/4570/24733/4570-24733-0005.flac	and beyond the limits of the duration of the idea of god supposing the latter at some time not to have existed or not to be going to exist thought would perforce have existed without the idea of god which is contrary to our hypothesis for we supposed that thought being given the idea of god necessarily flowed therefrom	4570
dev-other/4570/24733/4570-24733-0006.flac	bear in mind that the same proposition may be affirmed of anything which in any attribute necessarily follows from gods absolute nature	4570
dev-other/4570/24733/4570-24733-0007.flac	corollary hence it follows that god is not only the cause of things coming into existence but also of their continuing in existence that is in scholastic phraseology god is cause of the being of things essendi rerum	4570
dev-other/4570/24733/4570-24733-0008.flac	corollary individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of god or modes by which the attributes of god are expressed in a fixed and definite manner	4570

dev-other/4570/56594/4570-56594-0009.flac	he shut his mouth right in the middle of what he was sayin and looked at the preacher while his face got as red as fire	4570
dev-other/4570/56594/4570-56594-0010.flac	swearin says the old preacher is a terrible bad practice and there aint no use in it nohow	4570
dev-other/4570/56594/4570-56594-0011.flac	umphs but indiany kept shady he appeared to be cowed down	4570

dev-other/4570/56594/4570-56594-0018.flac	right out in the open air he asked	4570
dev-other/4572/112375/4572-112375-0000.flac	he heard the princes furious tread he saw his eyes glow fiercely red	4572
dev-other/4572/112375/4572-112375-0001.flac	swift sprang the monarch to his feet upstarting from his golden seat	4572

dev-other/4572/112375/4572-112375-0006.flac	he ceased and tara starry eyed thus to the angry prince replied not to my lord shouldst thou address a speech so fraught with bitterness not thus reproached my lord should be and least of all o prince by thee	4572

dev-other/4572/112381/4572-112381-0010.flac	and heard his waters roar and rave terrific with each crested wave	4572

dev-other/4831/18525/4831-18525-0007.flac	and presently a woman came and took little blue pinafore off and then the rest of the girls unclasped their hands and the ring melted away and the game was over	4831

dev-other/4831/25894/4831-25894-0005.flac	she thanked tommo and ran away to get ready for she felt sure her father would not refuse her anything	4831
dev-other/4831/25894/4831-25894-0006.flac	then she washed out little ranzas frock and put it to dry because she would not be able to do it the next day	4831
dev-other/4831/25894/4831-25894-0007.flac	she longed to make the beds and dress the children over night she was in such a hurry to have all in order but as that could not be she sat down again and tried over all the songs she knew	4831
dev-other/4831/25894/4831-25894-0008.flac	when she had told her plan peter benari shook his head and thought it would never do but tessa begged so hard he consented at last that she should try it for one week and sent her to bed the happiest little girl in new york	4831

dev-other/4831/25894/4831-25894-0013.flac	one fat old frenchman nodded to her and it seemed to help her very much for she began to sing before she thought and that was the hardest part of it	4831
dev-other/4831/25894/4831-25894-0014.flac	but tommo shook his curly head and answered soberly yes i took you there first for they love music and are of our country but up among the great houses we shall not always do well	4831
dev-other/4831/25894/4831-25894-0015.flac	but she had made half a dollar for tommo divided the money fairly and she felt rich with her share	4831
dev-other/4831/25894/4831-25894-0016.flac	her hands were covered with chilblains for she had no mittens but she put them under her shawl and scuffled merrily away in her big boots feeling so glad that the week was over and nearly three dollars safe in her pocket	4831
dev-other/4831/25894/4831-25894-0017.flac	how gay the streets were that day	4831
dev-other/4831/25894/4831-25894-0018.flac	how brisk every one was and how bright the faces looked as people trotted about with big baskets holly wreaths and young evergreens going to blossom into splendid christmas trees	4831
dev-other/4831/25894/4831-25894-0019.flac	but i cant so ill fill the socks all full and be happy said tessa as she looked wistfully into the gay stores and saw the heavy baskets go by	4831
dev-other/4831/25894/4831-25894-0020.flac	who knows what may happen if we do well returned tommo nodding wisely for he had a plan as well as tessa and kept chuckling over it as he trudged through the mud	4831

dev-other/4831/25894/4831-25894-0025.flac	as the door opened tessa saw what looked to her like a fairy feast all silver mugs and flowery plates and oranges and nuts and rosy wine in tall glass pitchers and smoking dishes that smelt so deliciously she could not restrain a little sniff of satisfaction	4831
dev-other/4831/25894/4831-25894-0026.flac	ah yes i shall come with much gladness and play as never in my life before cried tommo with a flourish of the old cap that made the children laugh	4831

dev-other/4831/25894/4831-25894-0029.flac	she got up early to see if the socks were all right and there she found the most astonishing sight	4831
dev-other/4831/25894/4831-25894-0030.flac	four socks instead of three and by the fourth pinned out quite elegantly was a little dress evidently meant for her a warm woollen dress all made and actually with bright buttons on it	4831
dev-other/4831/25894/4831-25894-0031.flac	tessa screamed and danced in her delight and up tumbled all the children to scream and dance with her making a regular carnival on a small scale	4831
dev-other/4831/25894/4831-25894-0032.flac	in her long stocking she found all sorts of treasures for tommo had stuffed it full of queer things and his mother had made gingerbread into every imaginable shape from fat pigs to full omnibuses	4831

dev-other/4831/25894/4831-25894-0034.flac	arose from the crowd of children gathered to the festival	4831
dev-other/4831/25894/4831-25894-0035.flac	before they went home the kind mamma told tessa she should be her friend and gave her a motherly kiss which warmed the childs heart and seemed to set a seal upon that promise	4831

dev-other/4831/29134/4831-29134-0002.flac	after that they began to come to themselves by degrees and presently the spell was wholly gone and they were reciting verses and pulling hair	4831
dev-other/4831/29134/4831-29134-0003.flac	the usual sunday school exercises were hurried through and then the minister got up and bored the house with a speech built on the customary sunday school plan then the superintendent put in his oar then the town dignitaries had their say	4831

dev-other/4831/29134/4831-29134-0014.flac	why the people gave him a towering illustrious position a grand imposing position	4831

dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0004.flac	but it was not these charms in lelechka that gave her mother the keenest joy	5543

dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0007.flac	it even seemed to serafima aleksandrovna that she was in love with her future husband and this made her happy	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0008.flac	the bride was also good looking she was a tall dark eyed dark haired girl somewhat timid but very tactful	5543

dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0010.flac	this might at the proper opportunity prove useful	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0011.flac	after their marriage there was nothing in the manner of sergey modestovich to suggest anything wrong to his wife	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0012.flac	later however when his wife was about to have a child sergey modestovich established connexions elsewhere of a light and temporary nature	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0013.flac	serafima aleksandrovna found this out and to her own astonishment was not particularly hurt she awaited her infant with a restless anticipation that swallowed every other feeling	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0014.flac	serafima aleksandrovna drifted farther and farther away from him	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0015.flac	lelechka then ran away stamping with her plump little legs over the carpets and hid herself behind the curtains near her bed	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0016.flac	where is my baby girl the mother asked as she looked for lelechka and made believe that she did not see her	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0017.flac	then she came out a little farther and her mother as though she had only just caught sight of her seized her by her little shoulders and exclaimed joyously here she is my lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0018.flac	her mothers eyes glowed with passionate emotion	5543

dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0024.flac	her mother was growing more absorbed every moment by her interest in the game her heart beat with short quick strokes and she pressed even closer to the wall disarranging her hair still more	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0025.flac	lelechka suddenly glanced toward her mothers corner and screamed with joy	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0026.flac	through the half closed doors he heard the laughter the joyous outcries the sound of romping	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0027.flac	even fedosya felt abashed now for her mistress now for herself	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0028.flac	he liked coming here where everything was beautifully arranged this was done by serafima aleksandrovna who wished to surround her little girl from her very infancy only with the loveliest things	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0029.flac	serafima aleksandrovna dressed herself tastefully this too she did for lelechka with the same end in view	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0030.flac	one thing sergey modestovich had not become reconciled to and this was his wifes almost continuous presence in the nursery	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0031.flac	its just as i thought i knew that id find you here he said with a derisive and condescending smile	5543

dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0036.flac	then they began to talk of something else	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0037.flac	that the mistress does it well thats one thing but that the young lady does it thats bad	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0038.flac	why asked fedosya with curiosity	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0039.flac	this expression of curiosity gave her face the look of a wooden roughly painted doll	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0040.flac	yes thats bad repeated agathya with conviction terribly bad well	5543

dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0043.flac	the old woman had invented this sign quite suddenly herself and she was evidently very proud of it	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0044.flac	madam madam she said quietly in a trembling voice	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0045.flac	serafima aleksandrovna gave a start	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0046.flac	fedosyas face made her anxious	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0047.flac	what is it fedosya she asked with great concern is there anything wrong with lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0048.flac	no madam said fedosya as she gesticulated with her hands to reassure her mistress and to make her sit down	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0049.flac	lelechka is asleep may god be with her	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0050.flac	only id like to say something you see lelechka is always hiding herself thats not good	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0051.flac	i cant tell you how bad it is said fedosya and her face expressed the most decided confidence	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0052.flac	i understand nothing of what you are saying	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0053.flac	you see madam its a kind of omen explained fedosya abruptly in a shamefaced way	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0054.flac	nonsense said serafima aleksandrovna	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0055.flac	who told you all this asked serafima aleksandrovna in an austere low voice	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0056.flac	knows exclaimed serafima aleksandrovna in irritation as though she wished to protect herself somehow from this sudden anxiety	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0057.flac	what nonsense as though lelechka could die	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0058.flac	she saw clearly that there could be no possible connexion between a childs quite ordinary diversion and the continuation of the childs life	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0059.flac	she made a special effort that evening to occupy her mind with other matters but her thoughts returned involuntarily to the fact that lelechka loved to hide herself	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0060.flac	when lelechka was still quite small and had learned to distinguish between her mother and her nurse she sometimes sitting in her nurses arms made a sudden roguish grimace and hid her laughing face in the nurses shoulder	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0061.flac	then she would look out with a sly glance	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0062.flac	though she reproached herself at once for this unfounded superstitious dread nevertheless she could not enter wholeheartedly into the spirit of lelechkas favourite game and she tried to divert lelechkas attention to something else	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0063.flac	she eagerly complied with her mothers new wishes	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0064.flac	serafima aleksandrovna tried desperately to amuse lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0065.flac	perhaps thought serafima aleksandrovna she is not as strongly drawn to the world as other children who are attracted by many things	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0066.flac	if this is so is it not a sign of organic weakness	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0067.flac	serafima aleksandrovna herself began the game once or twice though she played it with a heavy heart	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0068.flac	she suffered as though committing an evil deed with full consciousness	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0069.flac	it was a sad day for serafima aleksandrovna	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0070.flac	her mother covered her with a blue blanket	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0071.flac	lelechka drew her sweet little hands from under the blanket and stretched them out to embrace her mother her mother bent down	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0072.flac	she seemed so small and so frail under the blanket that covered her	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0073.flac	serafima aleksandrovna remained standing over lelechkas bed a long while and she kept looking at lelechka with tenderness and fear	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0074.flac	im a mother is it possible that i shouldnt be able to protect her she thought as she imagined the various ills that might befall lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0075.flac	she prayed long that night but the prayer did not relieve her sadness	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0076.flac	several days passed lelechka caught cold	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0077.flac	the fever came upon her at night	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0078.flac	when serafima aleksandrovna awakened by fedosya came to lelechka and saw her looking so hot so restless and so tormented she instantly recalled the evil omen and a hopeless despair took possession of her from the first moments	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0079.flac	a doctor was called and everything was done that is usual on such occasions but the inevitable happened	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0080.flac	and lelechka grew feebler from hour to hour	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0081.flac	nothing made her so unhappy as the reiterations of fedosya uttered between sobs she hid herself and hid herself our lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0082.flac	fever was consuming lelechka and there were times when she lost consciousness and spoke in delirium	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0083.flac	three days passed torturing like a nightmare	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0084.flac	serafima aleksandrovna hid her face behind the curtains near lelechkas bed how tragic	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0085.flac	a white mamochka whispered lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0086.flac	mamochkas white face became blurred and everything grew dark before lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0087.flac	she met her husband	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0088.flac	serafima aicksandrovna was standing by the coffin and looking dully at her dead child	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0089.flac	sima my dear dont agitate yourself said sergey modestovich in a whisper	5543

dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0091.flac	shell be up in a minute persisted serafima aleksandrovna her eyes fixed on the dead little girl	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0092.flac	sergey modestovich looked round him cautiously he was afraid of the unseemly and of the ridiculous	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0093.flac	sima dont agitate yourself he repeated	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0094.flac	he was confused and annoyed	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0095.flac	her face seemed tranquil and her eyes were dry	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0096.flac	she went into the nursery and began to walk round the room looking into those places where lelechka used to hide herself	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0097.flac	she walked all about the room and bent now and then to look under the table or under the bed and kept on repeating cheerfully where is my little one where is my lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0098.flac	after she had walked round the room once she began to make her quest anew	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0099.flac	fedosya motionless with dejected face sat in a corner and looked frightened at her mistress then she suddenly burst out sobbing and she wailed loudly	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0100.flac	she hid herself and hid herself our lelechka our angelic little soul	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0101.flac	when she entered the parlour there were several people between her and lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0102.flac	there was an oppressive feeling of heaviness in serafima aleksandrovnas head as she approached lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0103.flac	lelechka lay there still and pale and smiled pathetically	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0104.flac	the little one did not reply	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0105.flac	serafima aleksandrovna stood up erect sighed in a lost way smiled and called loudly lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0106.flac	lelechka was being carried out	5543
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0000.flac	captain bull the commander of a small garrison at saybrook permitted him to land but when the governor began to read his commission bull ordered him to be silent	5849

dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0002.flac	captain wadsworth became a little uneasy though he was still inclined to treat the matter lightly	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0003.flac	we have stubbornly refused to yield our charter voluntarily for it is the guardian of our political rights	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0004.flac	that is true captain wadsworth continued mister prince and to subdue our stubbornness this viceroy has come to hartford with sixty armed men to demand the surrender of the charter in person	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0005.flac	captain wadsworth bounded to his feet in a rage and placing his hand on the hilt of his sword declared he shall not have it	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0006.flac	the day was well nigh spent when he arrived and the members were engaged in a heated debate on a subject of the utmost importance	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0007.flac	he consented however to await the discussion but as soon as it was ended he declared that he would have the charter	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0008.flac	after the captain had taken two or three turns across the room he paused and asked	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0009.flac	what is the assembly doing engaged in a debate	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0010.flac	and will he wait until it has ended he has promised to do so	5849

dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0022.flac	charles got as close to the long table used by the secretaries as possible without attracting special attention	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0023.flac	the discussion went on darkness came and four lighted candles were placed on the table and two set on a shelf on the wall	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0024.flac	those two candles on the wall were a great annoyance to charles until he saw a man stationed near them	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0025.flac	though the lights were extinguished through the windows the faint starlight dimly illuminated the scene	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0026.flac	he followed him as rapidly as he could	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0027.flac	the youth was close behind him and when they were outside seized his arm	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0028.flac	boy have a care how you approach me	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0029.flac	the soldiers began to crowd about the house when at a signal from captain wadsworth the train bands came on the scene and prepared to grapple with the soldiers	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0030.flac	where is the charter	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0031.flac	you have your soldiers at the door and we have the train bands of connecticut ready to defend us against violence	5849

dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0038.flac	it remained vigorous bearing fruit every year until a little after midnight august eighteen fifty six when it was prostrated by a heavy storm of wind	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0039.flac	when the order for the seizure of the charters was first made known the assembly of rhode island sent a most loyal address to the king saying	5849

dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0041.flac	from that time until the enforced union of the colonies for mutual defence at the breaking out of the french and indian war the inhabitants of rhode island bore their share in the defensive efforts especially when the hostile savages hung along the frontiers of new york like an ill omened cloud	5849

dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0011.flac	it seemed a long time before any movement of the cable showed that the buoy was returning	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0012.flac	nearer and nearer it came until now a mans head could be seen	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0013.flac	the girls and women were too frightened to talk and nellie clung close to her mother	5849

dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0017.flac	but the half drowned man rubbed his eyes as if he could not believe them then the next minute he pressed his little daughter to his heart unable to speak a word	5849

dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0001.flac	and everybody was so happy	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0002.flac	the neptune the vessel that had struck on the sand bar was now safely anchored near shore and the sailors came in and out in row boats back and forth to land just as they wished	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0003.flac	then we had to go back to work at the logs went on the captain and then one of our crew took a fever	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0004.flac	that was what delayed us so	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0005.flac	finally we had every log loaded on the schooner and we started off	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0006.flac	we counted on getting home last week when this last storm struck us and drove us out of our course	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0007.flac	about the value asked mister bobbsey who was down from the city	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0008.flac	the value repeated the captain aside so that the strangers might not hear	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0009.flac	well im a rich man now and so is my mate mc laughlin for that wood was contracted for by the largest and richest piano firm in this country and now it is all but delivered to them and the money in our hands	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0010.flac	yes indeed it would have taken us a lifetime to accumulate as much money as we have earned in this year	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0011.flac	maybe aunt emily will take you down to the city on her shopping tour suggested nan	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0012.flac	he made the clerks remove all the truck from the aisles and i guess everybody was glad the army fell down	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0013.flac	the wonderful fresh air that these men lived in night and day had brightened their eyes too so that even the plainest face and the most awkward man among them was as nimble as an athlete from his perfect exercise	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0000.flac	i dont know how to say good by to you nellie told dorothy and nan next morning	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0001.flac	oh that will be splendid declared nan	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0002.flac	you are quite rich now arent you remarked dorothy	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0003.flac	and dorothy went up and down the room like the pictures of cinderellas proud sisters	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0004.flac	and we will be on hand thank you replied the joking dorothy	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0005.flac	come nellie called missus mc laughlin i am ready where is your hat	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0006.flac	we might be able to manage that too nellie told him	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0007.flac	my uncle is a fireman and he can take us through his engine house	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0008.flac	most of them i guess answered bert	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0009.flac	well we have had a good vacation and i am willing to go to work again	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0010.flac	so am i declared nan vacation was just long enough i think	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0011.flac	mister bobbsey was down from the city of course to take the family home and now all hands even freddie and flossie were busy packing up	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0012.flac	there were the shells to be looked after the fish nets besides downy the duck and snoop the cat	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0013.flac	and so our little friends had spent all their vacation	5849
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0000.flac	his characters get drunk or go mad with jealousy or fall in epileptic fits or rave hysterically	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0001.flac	if dostoevsky had had less vision he would have been strindberg	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0002.flac	like them he is a novelist of torture	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0003.flac	certainly the lust of cruelty the lust of destruction for destructions sake is the most conspicuous of the deadly sins in dostoevskys men and women	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0004.flac	he may not be a cruel author	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0005.flac	but they are never in balance they are always in demoniacal conflict	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0006.flac	even the lust is never or hardly ever the lust of a more or less sane man	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0007.flac	dostoevsky could not have described the sin of nekhludov in resurrection	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0008.flac	this is a madhouse cries some one in the idiot	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0009.flac	one result of this is a multiplicity of action	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0010.flac	even the talk is of actions more than of ideas	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0011.flac	he sows violent deeds not with the hand but with the sack	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0012.flac	but one had noticed during those last two days that the other was wearing a silver watch on a yellow bead chain which he seems not to have seen on him before	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0013.flac	he took a knife and when his friend had turned away he approached him cautiously from behind took aim turned his eyes heavenwards crossed himself and praying fervently god forgive me for christs sake	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0014.flac	he never paints everyman he always projects dostoevsky or a nightmare of dostoevsky	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0015.flac	that is why crime and punishment belongs to a lower range of fiction than anna karenina or fathers and sons	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0016.flac	we sympathize indeed with the fears the bravado the despair that succeed the crime	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0017.flac	he is a grotesque made alive by sheer imaginative intensity and passion	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0018.flac	one does not grudge an artist an abnormal character or two	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0019.flac	he invents vicious grotesques as dickens invents comic grotesques	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0020.flac	was very fond of hanging cats and burying them with great ceremony	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0021.flac	as for the karamazovs themselves he portrays the old father and the eldest of his sons hating each other and fighting like brutal maniacs	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0022.flac	serve him right shouted dmitri breathlessly	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0023.flac	if i havent killed him ill come again and kill him	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0024.flac	it is easy to see why dostoevsky has become a popular author	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0025.flac	no melodramatist ever poured out incident upon the stage from such a horn of plenty	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0026.flac	dostoevsky is always ready to show them all in at once	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0027.flac	on two opposite pages of the idiot one finds the following characters brought in by name general epanchin prince s adelaida ivanovna lizaveta prokofyevna yevgeny pavlovitch radomsky princess byelokonsky aglaia prince myshkin kolya ivolgin ippolit varya ferdyshchenko nastasya filippovna nina alexandrovna ganya ptitsyn and general ivolgin	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0028.flac	but the secret of dostoevskys appeal is something more than the multitude and thrill of his incidents and characters	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0029.flac	mister murry boldly faces the difficulty and attempts the definition	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0030.flac	to him dostoevskys work is the record of a great mind seeking for a way of life it is more than a record of struggle it is the struggle itself	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0031.flac	and those voices take shape in certain unforgettable fragments of dialogue that have been spoken by one spirit to another in some ugly mean tavern set in surrounding darkness	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0032.flac	ultimately they are the creations not of a man who desired to be but of a spirit which sought to know	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0033.flac	because they are possessed they are no longer men and women	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0034.flac	this is all in a measure true	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0035.flac	to say this is not to deny the spiritual content of dostoevskys work the anguish of the imprisoned soul as it battles with doubt and denial and despair	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0036.flac	there is in dostoevsky a suggestion of caliban trying to discover some better god than setebos	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0037.flac	the ultimate attitude of dostoevsky is as christian as the apostle peters lord i believe help thou mine unbelief	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0038.flac	and beyond the dark night of suffering and dissipating the night dostoevsky still sees the light of christian compassion	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0039.flac	or even by the compassion of others like prince myshkin in the idiot	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0040.flac	his work like his face bears the mark of this terrible conflict	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0041.flac	the novels are the perfect image of the man	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0042.flac	as to the man himself the vicomte de voguee described him as he saw him in the last years of his life	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0043.flac	when he became excited on a certain point one could have sworn that one had seen him before seated on a bench in a police court awaiting trial or among vagabonds who passed their time begging before the prison doors	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0044.flac	at all other times he carried that look of sad and gentle meekness seen on the images of old slavonic saints	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0045.flac	that is the portrait of the man one sees behind dostoevskys novels a portrait one might almost have inferred from the novels	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0046.flac	it is a figure that at once fascinates and repels	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0000.flac	he is not by temperament a singer	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0001.flac	his music is a still small voice unevenly matched against his consciousness of midnight and storm	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0002.flac	truth to tell mister hardy is neither sufficiently articulate nor sufficiently fastidious to be a great poet	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0003.flac	he does not express life easily in beautiful words or in images	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0004.flac	thus he writes in i found her out there of one who	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0005.flac	there could not be an uglier and more prosaic exaggeration than is contained in the image in the last line	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0006.flac	and prose intrudes in the choice of words as well as in images	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0007.flac	take for example the use of the word domiciled in the passage in the same poem about	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0008.flac	when we as strangers sought their catering care veiled smiles bespoke their thought of what we were	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0009.flac	catering care is an appalling phrase	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0010.flac	is a line of good poetry	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0011.flac	you did not come and marching time drew on and wore me numb yet less for loss of your dear presence there than that i thus found lacking in your make that high compassion which can overbear reluctance for pure loving kindness sake grieved i when as the hope hour stroked its sum you did not come	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0012.flac	there are hints of the grand style of lyric poetry in these lines but phrases like in your make and as the hope hour stroked its sum are discords that bring it tumbling to the levels of victorian commonplace	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0013.flac	he has a temperament sensitive beyond that of all but a few recent writers to the pain and passion of human beings	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0014.flac	one can remember poem after poem of his with a theme that might easily have served for mister hardy too late cristina the lost mistress the last ride together the statue and the bust to name a few	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0015.flac	but what a sense of triumph there is in brownings tragedies	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0016.flac	his world is a place of opulence not of poverty	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0017.flac	to have loved even for an hour is with browning to live for ever after in the inheritance of a mighty achievement	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0018.flac	to have loved for an hour is in mister hardys imagination to have deepened the sadness even more than the beauty of ones memories	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0019.flac	for then i undistrest by hearts grown cold to me could lonely wait my endless rest with equanimity	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0020.flac	but time to make me grieve part steals lets part abide and shakes this fragile frame at eve with throbbings of noontide	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0021.flac	and despair is by no means triumphant in what is perhaps the most attractive of all mister hardys poems the oxen	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0022.flac	we pictured the meek mild creatures where they dwelt in their strawy pen nor did it occur to one of us there to doubt they were kneeling then	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0023.flac	the mood of faith however or rather of delight in the memory of faith is not mister hardys prevailing mood	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0024.flac	he can enter upon a war without ironical doubts as we see in the song men who march away	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0025.flac	how long he cries in a poem written some years ago	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0026.flac	when shall the saner softer polities whereof we dream have sway in each proud land and patriotism grown godlike scorn to stand bondslave to realms but circle earth and seas	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0027.flac	but perhaps his characteristic attitude to war is to be found not in lines like these but in that melancholy poem the souls of the slain in which the souls of the dead soldiers return to their country and question a senior soul flame as to how their friends and relatives have kept their doughty deeds in remembrance	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0028.flac	and general how hold out our sweethearts sworn loyal as doves	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0029.flac	some fickle and fleet hearts have found them new loves	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0030.flac	and our wives quoth another resignedly dwell they on our deeds	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0031.flac	mister hardy has too bitter a sense of reality to believe much in the glory of war	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0032.flac	the real world to mister hardy is the world of ancient human things in which war has come to be a hideous irrelevance	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0033.flac	it may be thought on the other hand that mister hardys poems about war are no more expressive of tragic futility than his poems about love	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0034.flac	futility and frustration are ever recurring themes in both	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0035.flac	his lovers like his soldiers rot in the grave defeated of their glory	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0036.flac	lovers are always severed both in life and in death	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0037.flac	in beyond the last lamp we have the same mournful cry over severance	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0038.flac	no shade of pinnacle or tree or tower while earth endures will fall on my mound and within the hour steal on to yours one robin never haunt our two green covertures	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0039.flac	they bring us face to face with an experience intenser than our own	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0040.flac	nothing of tiniest worth have i wrought pondered planned no one thing asking blame or praise since the pale corpse like birth of this diurnal unit bearing blanks in all its rays dullest of dull hued days	6123
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0000.flac	its a sad thing for a body to lack brains when she wants to be a teacher isnt it	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0001.flac	penelope has studied so hard all winter and she hasnt gone anywhere thought the older sister wistfully	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0002.flac	doris dreamed of pretty dresses all that night and thought about them all the next day	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0003.flac	so it must be confessed did penelope though she would not have admitted it for the world	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0004.flac	she knew that penelope had started out to say a new dress	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0005.flac	doris hunter i believe its an old quilt	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0006.flac	listen penelope my dear doris	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0007.flac	love to penelope and yourself	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0008.flac	your affectionate aunt adella hunter	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0009.flac	i dont see its beauty said penelope with a grimace	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0010.flac	it may have been pretty once but it is all faded now	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0011.flac	tell me dorrie does it argue a lack of proper respect for my ancestors that i cant feel very enthusiastic over this heirloom especially when grandmother hunter died years before i was born	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0012.flac	it was very kind of aunt adella to send it said doris dutifully	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0013.flac	why the wrong side is ever so much prettier than the right exclaimed penelope	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0014.flac	what lovely old timey stuff and not a bit faded	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0015.flac	i declare it is as good as new	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0016.flac	well let us go and have tea said penelope im decidedly hungry	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0017.flac	besides i see the poverty pucker coming	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0018.flac	it is something to possess an heirloom after all	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0019.flac	penelope was surprised as much as the tender sisterly heart could wish when doris flashed out upon her triumphantly on the evening of the party with the black skirt nicely pressed and re hung and the prettiest waist imaginable a waist that was a positive creation of dainty rose besprinkled silk with a girdle and knots of black velvet	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0020.flac	so penelope went to blanches party and her dress was the admiration of every girl there	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0021.flac	penelope thought her altogether charming	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0022.flac	she looks as if she had just stepped out of the frame of some lovely old picture she said to herself	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0023.flac	my aunt adella gave me gave us the material she stammered	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0024.flac	i am named after her missus fairweather suddenly put her arm about penelope and drew the young girl to her her lovely old face aglow with delight and tenderness	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0025.flac	then you are my grandniece she said	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0026.flac	when i saw your dress i felt sure you were related to her i should recognize that rosebud silk if i came across it in thibet	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0027.flac	penelope was four years older than i was but we were devoted to each other	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0028.flac	soon after this our mother died and our household was broken up	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0029.flac	my dear i am a very lonely old woman with nobody belonging to me	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0030.flac	now she patted missus fairweathers soft old hand affectionately	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0031.flac	doris and penelope found their lives and plans changed in the twinkling of an eye	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0032.flac	when missus fairweather had gone doris and penelope looked at each other	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0000.flac	as she slipped into her blue print afternoon dress her aunt called to her from below	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0001.flac	aunt jane was standing at the foot of the stairs with a lamp in one hand and a year old baby clinging to the other	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0002.flac	she was a big shapeless woman with a round good natured face cheerful and vulgar as a sunflower was aunt jane at all times and occasions	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0003.flac	i want to run over and see how missus brixby is this evening siddy and you must take care of the baby till i get back	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0004.flac	sidney sighed and went downstairs for the baby	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0005.flac	all her days were alike as far as hard work and dullness went but she accepted them cheerfully and uncomplainingly	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0006.flac	but she did resent having to look after the baby when she wanted to write her letter	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0007.flac	the room was small a mere box above the kitchen which sidney shared with two small cousins	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0008.flac	her bed and the cot where the little girls slept filled up almost all the available space	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0009.flac	just at that particular angle one eye appeared to be as large as an orange while the other was the size of a pea and the mouth zigzagged from ear to ear	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0010.flac	sidney hated that mirror as virulently as she could hate anything	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0011.flac	her mother had died the day after and sidney thereupon had come into the hands of good aunt jane with those books for her dowry since nothing else was left after the expenses of the double funeral had been paid	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0012.flac	presently she began to write with a flush of real excitement on her face	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0013.flac	only one answer came to ellen douglas and that was forwarded to her by the long suffering editor of the maple leaf	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0014.flac	he wrote that although his age debarred him from membership in the club he was twenty and the limit was eighteen he read the letters of the department with much interest and often had thought of answering some of the requests for correspondents	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0015.flac	he never had done so but ellen douglass letter was so interesting that he had decided to write to her	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0016.flac	would she be kind enough to correspond with him	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0017.flac	he was two years out from the east and had not yet forgotten to be homesick at times	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0018.flac	sidney liked the letter and answered it	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0019.flac	she never expected to meet john lincoln nor did she wish to do so	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0020.flac	in the correspondence itself she found her pleasure	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0021.flac	john lincoln wrote breezy accounts of ranch life and adventures on the far western plains so alien and remote from snug humdrum plainfield life that sidney always had the sensation of crossing a gulf when she opened a letter from the bar n as for sidneys own letter this is the way it read as she wrote it	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0022.flac	the evergreens plainfield dear mister lincoln	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0023.flac	i love life and its bloom and brilliancy i love meeting new people i love the ripple of music the hum of laughter and conversation	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0024.flac	the man i had been talking with was paul moore the great novelist	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0025.flac	as it was i had contradicted him twice and he had laughed and liked it but his books will always have a new meaning to me henceforth through the insight he himself has given me	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0026.flac	it is such meetings as these that give life its sparkle for me	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0027.flac	you will be weary of my rhapsodies over her	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0028.flac	she has sympathy and understanding for my every mood	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0029.flac	yours sincerely sidney richmond	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0030.flac	aunt jane came home presently and carried away her sleeping baby sidney said her prayers went to bed and slept soundly and serenely she mailed her letter the next day and a month later an answer came	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0031.flac	sidney did not sleep that night but tossed restlessly about or cried in her pillow	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0032.flac	the good woman shook her head	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0033.flac	sidney trod the way of the transgressor and found that its thorns pierced to bone and marrow	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0034.flac	you see that road out thar	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0035.flac	and there was no harbour or glimpse of distant sea visible	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0036.flac	had the hotel keeper made a mistake	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0037.flac	this is his place nobody calls it the evergreens but myself	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0038.flac	i dont understand he said perplexedly	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0039.flac	oh sidney threw out her hands in a burst of passionate protest	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0040.flac	no and you never will understand i cant make you understand	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0041.flac	everything i told you about it and my life was just imagination	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0042.flac	then why did you write them he asked blankly	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0043.flac	why did you deceive me	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0044.flac	oh i didnt mean to deceive you i never thought of such a thing	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0045.flac	i just couldnt write you about my life here not because it was hard but it was so ugly and empty	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0046.flac	and when once i had begun i had to keep it up	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0047.flac	i found it so fascinating too	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0048.flac	those letters made that other life seem real to me i never expected to meet you	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0049.flac	these last four days since your letter came have been dreadful to me	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0050.flac	oh please go away and forgive me if you can	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0051.flac	it was worse than she had even thought it would be	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0052.flac	he was so handsome so manly so earnest eyed	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0053.flac	john lincoln opened the gate and went up to her	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0054.flac	please dont distress yourself so sidney he said unconsciously using her christian name	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0055.flac	i think i do understand	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0056.flac	im not such a dull fellow as you take me for	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0057.flac	after all those letters were true or rather there was truth in them	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0058.flac	this young man was certainly good at understanding	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0059.flac	you youll forgive me then she stammered	6267
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0000.flac	hallo colonel how dye sell your wood this time	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0001.flac	why capting we must charge you three and a quarter this time the d l	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0002.flac	supper was over and i retired to my upper berth situated alongside and overlooking the brag table where the captain was deeply engaged having now the other pilot as his principal opponent	6455

dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0004.flac	this pilots beating us all to smash the wooding completed we paddled on again	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0005.flac	they were anxious to learn the game and they did learn it	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0006.flac	still with all these disadvantages they continued playing they wanted to learn the game	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0007.flac	oh pretty glibly sir replied the mate we can scarcely tell what headway we are making for we are obliged to keep the middle of the river and there is the shadow of a fog rising	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0008.flac	this wood seems rather better than that we took in at yellow faces but were nearly out again and must be looking out for more	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0009.flac	i saw a light just ahead on the right shall we hail	6455

dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0013.flac	the other pilots voice was again heard on deck how much have you	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0014.flac	only about ten cords sir was the reply of the youthful salesman	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0015.flac	the captain here told thompson to take six cords which would last till daylight and again turned his attention to the game	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0016.flac	the pilots here changed places when did they sleep	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0017.flac	wood taken in the caravan again took her place in the middle of the stream paddling on as usual day at length dawned	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0018.flac	i had risen and went out with the captain to enjoy a view of the bluffs	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0019.flac	there it is exclaimed the captain stop her	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0000.flac	chapter twenty three may i go	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0001.flac	the very day after this octavia opened the fourth trunk	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0002.flac	evidently something had happened octavia she said mister dugald binnie is at oldclough who is he	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0003.flac	he is my grand uncle explained lucia tremulously he has a great deal of money	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0004.flac	i do not quite understand grandmamma octavia she said	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0005.flac	last night she came to my room to talk to me and this morning she came again and oh	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0006.flac	she broke out indignantly how could she speak to me in such a manner	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0007.flac	what did you understand	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0008.flac	i am to run after a man who does not care for me and make myself attractive in the hope that he will condescend to marry me because mister binnie may leave me his money	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0009.flac	do you wonder that it took even lady theobald a long time to say that	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0010.flac	well remarked octavia you wont do it i suppose i wouldnt worry	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0011.flac	oh i always knew it i didnt guess	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0012.flac	and she smiled ever so faintly	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0013.flac	that is one of the reasons why she loathes me so she added	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0014.flac	lucia thought deeply for a moment she recognized all at once several things she had been mystified by before	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0015.flac	octavia smiled a little again	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0016.flac	lucia sat thinking her hands clasped tightly	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0017.flac	i am glad i came here she said at length	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0018.flac	i think i shall never be afraid of her any more	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0019.flac	her delicate nostrils were dilated she held her head up her breath came fast there was a hint of exultation in her tone	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0020.flac	she walked very fast after she left the house	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0021.flac	but it was not against him that lucias indignation was aroused	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0022.flac	she wondered if he had heard her last words she fancied he had	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0023.flac	he took hold of her shaking little hand and looked down at her excited face	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0024.flac	i am angry she said you have never seen me angry before	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0025.flac	i am on my way to my to lady theobald	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0026.flac	he held her hand as calmly as before	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0027.flac	what are you going to say to her he asked she laughed again	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0028.flac	he held her hand rather closer	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0029.flac	she has made you very angry he said	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0030.flac	and then almost before she knew what she was doing she was pouring forth the whole of her story even more of it than she had told octavia	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0031.flac	lucia he said i wish you would let me go and talk with lady theobald you she said with a little start	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0032.flac	yes he answered let me go to her	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0033.flac	if you will say yes to that i think i can promise that you need never be afraid of her any more	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0034.flac	the fierce color died out of her cheeks and the tears rushed to her eyes	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0035.flac	she raised her face with a pathetic look	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0036.flac	i am desperately in love with you he answered in his quietest way	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0000.flac	i accompany my granddaughter to this this entertainment her ladyship responded	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0001.flac	it is scarcely a joyous occasion to my mind	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0002.flac	no need to dress yourself like that if it isnt ejaculated mister binnie	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0003.flac	if i were sure this was the same man id go myself	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0004.flac	when i find a fellow whos neither knave nor fool i stick to him believe ill send to find out	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0005.flac	the only time he had made any comment upon her was the first time he saw her in the dress she had copied from octavias nice gown that he blurted out didnt get it here ill wager	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0006.flac	doesnt look like it he said gruffly	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0007.flac	no she answered i am not afraid at all	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0008.flac	i shall not be afraid again	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0009.flac	in fact she had perfectly confounded her ladyship by her demeanor	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0010.flac	i beg you will not speak to me of that again she said i will not listen	6455

dev-other/6599/38591/6599-38591-0003.flac	at last he decided upon retreating	6599
dev-other/6599/38591/6599-38591-0004.flac	it was garcilaso de la vega the prince of spanish poesy the spanish petrarch according to his fellow countrymen	6599
dev-other/6599/38591/6599-38591-0005.flac	montmorency signed a similar one for piedmont	6599
dev-other/6599/38591/6599-38591-0006.flac	they all repaired together to the house prepared for their reception and after dinner the emperor being tired lay down to rest on a couch queen eleanor before long went and tapped at his door and sent word to the king that the emperor was awake	6599
dev-other/6599/38591/6599-38591-0007.flac	francis with the cardinal de lorraine and the constable de montmorency soon arrived	6599
dev-other/6599/38591/6599-38591-0008.flac	on entering the chamber he found the emperor still lying down and chatting with his sister the queen who was seated beside him on a chair	6599
dev-other/6599/38591/6599-38591-0009.flac	yes said charles i had made such cheer that i was obliged to sleep it off	6599
dev-other/6599/38591/6599-38591-0010.flac	francis did the converse with his own collar	6599
dev-other/6599/38591/6599-38591-0011.flac	only seven of the attendants remained in the emperors chamber and there the two sovereigns conversed for an hour after which they moved to the hall where a splendid supper awaited them	6599

dev-other/6599/38591/6599-38591-0013.flac	orders had been sent everywhere to receive him as kings of france are received on their joyous accession	6599
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0000.flac	but since there existed for us no responsibility we each reported dutifully at the roll call of habit and dropped back into our blankets with a grateful sigh	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0001.flac	i remember the moon sailing a good gait among apparently stationary cloudlets i recall a deep black shadow lying before distant silvery mountains i glanced over the stark motionless canvases each of which concealed a man the air trembled with the bellowing of cattle in the corrals	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0002.flac	seemingly but a moment later the cooks howl brought me to consciousness again	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0003.flac	three were to care for the remuda five were to move the stray herd from the corrals to good feed three branding crews were told to brand the calves we had collected in the cut of the afternoon before that took up about half the men	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0004.flac	the rest were to make a short drive in the salt grass	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0005.flac	we were the only ones who did go afoot however although the corrals were not more than two hundred yards distant	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0006.flac	between the upright bars of greasewood we could see the cattle and near the opposite side the men building a fire next the fence	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0007.flac	we pushed open the wide gate and entered	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0008.flac	one stood waiting for them to finish a sheaf of long j h stamping irons in his hand	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0009.flac	all the rest squatted on their heels along the fence smoking cigarettes and chatting together	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0010.flac	the first rays of the sun slanted across in one great sweep from the remote mountains	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0011.flac	homer wooden and old california john rode in among the cattle	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0012.flac	as the loop settled he jerked sharply upward exactly as one would strike to hook a big fish	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0013.flac	homer wrapped the rope twice or thrice about the horn and sat over in one stirrup to avoid the tightened line and to preserve the balance	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0014.flac	nobody paid any attention to the calf	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0015.flac	behind him followed his anxious mother her head swinging from side to side near the fire the horse stopped	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0016.flac	the two bull doggers immediately pounced upon the victim	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0017.flac	it was promptly flopped over on its right side	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0018.flac	thus the calf was unable to struggle	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0019.flac	when once you have had the wind knocked out of you or a rib or two broken you cease to think this unnecessarily rough	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0020.flac	hot iron yelled one of the bull doggers	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0021.flac	marker yelled the other	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0022.flac	the brander pressed the iron smoothly against the flank	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0023.flac	perhaps the calf blatted a little as the heat scorched	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0024.flac	the brand showed cherry which is the proper colour to indicate due peeling and a successful mark	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0025.flac	then he nicked out a swallow tail in the other	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0026.flac	it seems to me that a great deal of unnecessary twaddle is abroad as to the extreme cruelty of branding	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0027.flac	undoubtedly it is to some extent painful and could some other method of ready identification be devised it might be as well to adopt it in preference	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0028.flac	inextinguishable laughter followed the spread of this doctrine through arizona	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0029.flac	imagine a puncher descending to examine politely the ear tags of wild cattle on the open range or in a round up	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0030.flac	a calf usually bellows when the iron bites but as soon as released he almost invariably goes to feeding or to looking idly about	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0031.flac	besides which it happens but once in a lifetime and is over in ten seconds a comfort denied to those of us who have our teeth filled	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0032.flac	one of the little animals was but a few months old so the rider did not bother with its hind legs but tossed his loop over its neck	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0033.flac	mister frosts bull calf alone in pictorial history shows the attitudes	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0034.flac	and then of course there was the gorgeous contrast between all this frantic and uncomprehending excitement and the absolute matter of fact imperturbability of horse and rider	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0035.flac	as he knew his business and as the calf was a small one the little beast went over promptly bit the ground with a whack and was pounced upon and held	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0036.flac	he would catch himself on one foot scramble vigorously and end by struggling back to the upright	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0037.flac	you can imagine what happened next	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0038.flac	this is productive of some fun if it fails	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0039.flac	by now the branding was in full swing	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0040.flac	when the nooses fell they turned and walked toward the fire as a matter of course rarely did the cast fail	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0041.flac	men ran to and fro busy and intent	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0042.flac	sometimes three or four calves were on the ground at once	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0043.flac	dust eddied and dissipated	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0044.flac	no more necked calves they announced	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0045.flac	then he would spit on his hands and go at it alone	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0046.flac	if luck attended his first effort his sarcasm was profound theres yore little calf said he	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0047.flac	would you like to have me tote it to you or do you reckon you could toddle this far with yore little old iron	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0048.flac	toward noon the work slacked	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0049.flac	finally homer rode over to the cattleman and reported the branding finished	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0050.flac	the latter counted the marks in his tally book	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0051.flac	one hundred and seventy six he announced	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0052.flac	the markers squatted on their heels told over the bits of ears they had saved	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0053.flac	the total amounted to but an hundred and seventy five	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0054.flac	finally wooden discovered it in his hip pocket	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0055.flac	they had been doing a wrestlers heavy work all the morning but did not seem to be tired	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0056.flac	i saw once in some crank physical culture periodical that a cowboys life was physically ill balanced like an oarsmans in that it exercised only certain muscles of the body	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0000.flac	at this moment the heavy beat of the storm on the roof ceased with miraculous suddenness leaving the outside world empty of sound save for the drip drip drip of eaves	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0001.flac	we had every sort of people with us off and on and as i was lookout at a popular game i saw them all	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0002.flac	at the same instant i heard the rip of steel through cloth and felt a sharp stab in my left leg	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0003.flac	then i scouted to see what had cut me and found that the fellow had lost a hand	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0004.flac	in place of it he wore a sharp steel hook	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0005.flac	there was no doubt of his being alive for he was breathing hard like a man does when he gets hit over the head it didnt sound good	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0006.flac	when a man breathes that way hes mostly all gone	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0007.flac	men got batted over the head often enough in those days	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0008.flac	sour wine is fine to put a wound in shape to heal but its no soothing syrup	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0009.flac	their coffin was their ship and their grave it was the sea blow high blow low what care we and the quarter that we gave them was to sink them in the sea down on the coast of the high barbaree	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0010.flac	it fair made my hair rise to hear him with the big still solemn desert outside and the quiet moonlight and the shadows and him sitting up straight and gaunt his eyes blazing each side his big eagle nose and his snaky hair hanging over the raw cut across his head	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0011.flac	however i made out to get him bandaged up and in shape and pretty soon he sort of went to sleep	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0012.flac	then again hed sing that barbaree song until id go out and look at the old colorado flowing by just to be sure i hadnt died and gone below or else hed just talk	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0013.flac	he began when he was a kid and he gave his side of conversations pausing for replies	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0014.flac	i used to listen by the hour but i never made out anything really important as to who the man was or where hed come from or what hed done	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0015.flac	i didnt pay any attention to him for he was quiet	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0016.flac	usually i didnt bother with his talk for it didnt mean anything but something in his voice made me turn	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0017.flac	he was lying on his side those black eyes of his blazing at me but now both of them saw the same distance	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0018.flac	where are my clothes he asked very intense	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0019.flac	one little squeeze talk about your deadly weapons	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0020.flac	but hed been too sick and too long abed	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0021.flac	in a minute or so he came to	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0022.flac	now youre a nice sweet proposition said i as soon as i was sure he could understand me	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0023.flac	theyre safe enough let me have them he begged	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0024.flac	now look here said i you cant get up to day you aint fit	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0025.flac	i know he pleaded but let me see them	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0026.flac	just to satisfy him i passed over his old duds	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0027.flac	ive been robbed he cried	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0028.flac	wheres my coat he asked	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0029.flac	you had no coat when i picked you up i replied	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0030.flac	he looked at me mighty suspicious but didnt say anything more he wouldnt even answer when i spoke to him	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0031.flac	after hed eaten a fair meal he fell asleep	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0032.flac	when i came back that evening the bunk was empty and he was gone	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0033.flac	i didnt see him again for two days	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0034.flac	then i caught sight of him quite a ways off	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0035.flac	guess he suspicions i stole that old coat of his thinks i and afterwards i found that my surmise had been correct	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0036.flac	however he didnt stay long in that frame of mind	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0037.flac	i ran up pulling my gun	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0038.flac	the mex was flat on his face his arms stretched out	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0039.flac	on the middle of his back knelt my one armed friend	6841

dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0042.flac	the gleam died from his eye the snarl left his lips	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0043.flac	in any case he flew poco pronto leaving me and my friend together	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0044.flac	during the next two months he was a good deal about town mostly doing odd jobs i saw him off and on	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0045.flac	however i didnt pay much attention to that being at the time almighty busy holding down my card games	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0046.flac	thats all right said i but you better stay right there	6841

dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0000.flac	junior avonlea found it hard to settle down to humdrum existence again	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0001.flac	perhaps after a while ill get used to it but im afraid concerts spoil people for everyday life	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0002.flac	i suppose that is why marilla disapproves of them	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0003.flac	i feel just now that i may grow up to be sensible yet	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0004.flac	i just lay awake and imagined the concert over and over again	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0005.flac	eventually however avonlea school slipped back into its old groove and took up its old interests	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0006.flac	none of the sloanes would have any dealings with the bells because the bells had declared that the sloanes had too much to do in the program and the sloanes had retorted that the bells were not capable of doing the little they had to do properly	700

dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0008.flac	on annes birthday they were tripping lightly down it keeping eyes and ears alert amid all their chatter for miss stacy had told them that they must soon write a composition on a winters walk in the woods and it behooved them to be observant	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0009.flac	i can scarcely realize that im in my teens	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0010.flac	its a great comfort to think that ill be able to use big words then without being laughed at	700

dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0019.flac	its called the jealous rival or in death not divided	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0020.flac	i read it to marilla and she said it was stuff and nonsense	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0021.flac	its a sad sweet story	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0022.flac	cordelia was a regal brunette with a coronet of midnight hair and duskly flashing eyes	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0023.flac	you know so much more than you did when you were only twelve	700

dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0025.flac	i asked ruby gillis if she knew anything about how men proposed because i thought shed likely be an authority on the subject having so many sisters married	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0026.flac	but she pretended to be geraldines friend the same as ever	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0027.flac	let you and me have a story club all our own and write stories for practice	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0028.flac	you ought to cultivate your imagination you know miss stacy says so	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0029.flac	only we must take the right way	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0030.flac	this was how the story club came into existence	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0031.flac	no boys were allowed in it although ruby gillis opined that their admission would make it more exciting and each member had to produce one story a week	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0032.flac	each girl has to read her story out loud and then we talk it over	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0033.flac	mine is rosamond montmorency all the girls do pretty well	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0034.flac	im sure that must have a wholesome effect	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0035.flac	the moral is the great thing mister allan says so	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0036.flac	i read one of my stories to him and missus allan and they both agreed that the moral was excellent	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0037.flac	jane and ruby almost always cry when i come to the pathetic parts	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0038.flac	miss josephine barry wrote back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0039.flac	im sure missus allan was never such a silly forgetful little girl as you are	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0040.flac	i felt so encouraged when i heard that	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0041.flac	missus lynde says she always feels shocked when she hears of anyone ever having been naughty no matter how small they were	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0042.flac	now i wouldnt have felt that way	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0000.flac	vanity and vexation of spirit	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0001.flac	the spring was abroad in the land and marillas sober middle aged step was lighter and swifter because of its deep primal gladness	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0002.flac	i must say with all her faults i never found her disobedient or untrustworthy before and im real sorry to find her so now	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0003.flac	perhaps youre judging her too hasty marilla	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0004.flac	of course i knew youd take her part matthew but im bringing her up not you	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0005.flac	demanded marilla anxiously going over to the bed	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0006.flac	anne cowered deeper into her pillows as if desirous of hiding herself forever from mortal eyes no	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0007.flac	get right up this minute and tell me	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0008.flac	this minute i say there now what is it	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0009.flac	anne had slid to the floor in despairing obedience	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0010.flac	yes its green moaned anne	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0011.flac	i thought nothing could be as bad as red hair	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0012.flac	you havent got into any scrape for over two months and i was sure another one was due	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0013.flac	now then what did you do to your hair	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0014.flac	anne shirley didnt you know it was a wicked thing to do	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0015.flac	yes i knew it was a little wicked admitted anne	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0016.flac	i know what it feels like to have your word doubted	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0017.flac	and missus allan says we should never suspect anyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that theyre not	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0018.flac	but i hadnt then and i believed every word he said implicitly	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0019.flac	who said who are you talking about	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0020.flac	oh i didnt let him in the house	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0021.flac	in a trice i saw myself with beautiful raven black hair and the temptation was irresistible	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0022.flac	oh marilla what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0023.flac	your hair must be cut off there is no other way you cant go out with it looking like that	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0024.flac	with a dismal sigh she went for the scissors	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0025.flac	but there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because youve dyed it a dreadful color is there	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0026.flac	im going to weep all the time youre cutting it off if it wont interfere	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0027.flac	it seems such a tragic thing	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0028.flac	anne wept then but later on when she went upstairs and looked in the glass she was calm with despair	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0029.flac	yes i will too	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0030.flac	i never thought i was vain about my hair of all things but now i know i was in spite of its being red because it was so long and thick and curly	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0031.flac	i expect something will happen to my nose next	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0032.flac	annes clipped head made a sensation in school on the following monday but to her relief nobody guessed the real reason for it not even josie pye who however did not fail to inform anne that she looked like a perfect scarecrow	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0033.flac	its hard to be told you look like a scarecrow and i wanted to say something back but i didnt	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0034.flac	it makes you feel very virtuous when you forgive people doesnt it	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0035.flac	i mean to devote all my energies to being good after this and i shall never try to be beautiful again	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0036.flac	of course its better to be good	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0037.flac	i do really want to be good marilla like you and missus allan and miss stacy and grow up to be a credit to you	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0038.flac	diana says when my hair begins to grow to tie a black velvet ribbon around my head with a bow at one side	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0039.flac	i will call it a snood that sounds so romantic	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0040.flac	my head is better now	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0041.flac	it was terrible bad this afternoon though	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0000.flac	of course you must be elaine anne said diana	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0001.flac	of course it would be romantic conceded jane andrews but i know i couldnt keep still	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0002.flac	but its so ridiculous to have a redheaded elaine mourned anne	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0003.flac	and elaine was the lily maid	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0004.flac	your complexion is just as fair as rubys said diana earnestly and your hair is ever so much darker than it used to be before you cut it	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0005.flac	it was splendid to fish for trout over the bridge and the two girls learned to row themselves about in the little flat bottomed dory mister barry kept for duck shooting	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0006.flac	it was annes idea that they dramatize elaine	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0007.flac	those days she said were so much more romantic than the present	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0008.flac	they had often gone down like this and nothing could be more convenient for playing elaine	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0009.flac	the black shawl having been procured anne spread it over the flat and then lay down on the bottom with closed eyes and hands folded over her breast	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0010.flac	it spoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before missus lynde was born	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0011.flac	jane you arrange this	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0012.flac	its silly for elaine to be talking when shes dead	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0013.flac	jane rose to the occasion	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0014.flac	left behind at the landing	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0015.flac	anne gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard she was white to the lips but she did not lose her self possession	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0016.flac	there was one chance just one	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0017.flac	under such circumstances you dont think much about making a flowery prayer	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0018.flac	the flat drifted under the bridge and then promptly sank in midstream	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0019.flac	ruby jane and diana already awaiting it on the lower headland saw it disappear before their very eyes and had not a doubt but that anne had gone down with it	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0020.flac	the minutes passed by each seeming an hour to the unfortunate lily maid	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0021.flac	why didnt somebody come where had the girls gone	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0022.flac	her imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome possibilities to her	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0023.flac	anne shirley	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0024.flac	how on earth did you get there he exclaimed	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0025.flac	it was certainly extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0026.flac	what has happened anne	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0027.flac	asked gilbert taking up his oars	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0028.flac	we were playing elaine explained anne frigidly without even looking at her rescuer and i had to drift down to camelot in the barge i mean the flat	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0029.flac	for a moment anne hesitated	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0030.flac	her heart gave a quick queer little beat	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0031.flac	her resentment which to other and older people might be as laughable as its cause was in no whit allayed and softened by time seemingly	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0032.flac	no she said coldly i shall never be friends with you gilbert blythe and i dont want to be	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0033.flac	all right	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0034.flac	ill never ask you to be friends again anne shirley and i dont care either	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0035.flac	of course he had insulted her terribly but still	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0036.flac	everything i do gets me or my dearest friends into a scrape	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0037.flac	annes presentiment proved more trustworthy than presentiments are apt to do	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0038.flac	will you ever have any sense anne groaned marilla	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0039.flac	i dont see how said marilla	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0040.flac	ever since i came to green gables ive been making mistakes and each mistake has helped to cure me of some great shortcoming	700

dev-other/7601/101619/7601-101619-0001.flac	the highest and fullest contentment offers more of the grave than of the merry ipsa felicitas se nisi temperat premit even felicity unless it moderate itself oppresses	7601
dev-other/7601/101619/7601-101619-0002.flac	socrates says that some god tried to mix in one mass and to confound pain and pleasure but not being able to do it he bethought him at least to couple them by the tail metrodorus said that in sorrow there is some mixture of pleasure	7601
dev-other/7601/101619/7601-101619-0003.flac	nature discovers this confusion to us painters hold that the same motions and grimaces of the face that serve for weeping serve for laughter too and indeed before the one or the other be finished do but observe the painters manner of handling and you will be in doubt to which of the two the design tends and the extreme of laughter does at last bring tears	7601
dev-other/7601/101619/7601-101619-0004.flac	and therefore common and less speculative souls are found to be more proper for and more successful in the management of affairs and the elevated and exquisite opinions of philosophy unfit for business this sharp vivacity of soul and the supple and restless volubility attending it disturb our negotiations	7601

dev-other/7601/101622/7601-101622-0000.flac	the romans by this means erected their colonies for perceiving their city to grow immeasurably populous they eased it of the most unnecessary people and sent them to inhabit and cultivate the lands conquered by them sometimes also they purposely maintained wars with some of their enemies not only to keep their own men in action for fear lest idleness the mother of corruption should bring upon them some worse inconvenience	7601

dev-other/7641/96252/7641-96252-0005.flac	we who here seek the theory of virtue and have therefore also to express abstractly the nature of the knowledge which lies at its foundation will yet be unable to convey that knowledge itself in this expression	7641

dev-other/7641/96684/7641-96684-0038.flac	then admetus raised the veil of the woman he had taken across the threshold of his house	7641
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0000.flac	he now went on till he came to the house at the door of which he was to knock this he did two or three times	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0001.flac	christian i have come to see the good man of the house	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0002.flac	christian sir i am come from the city of destruction and am on my way to mount zion	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0003.flac	i was told by the man that stands at the gate that if i came here you would show me good things that would help me	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0004.flac	he stood as if he would plead for men and a crown of gold hung near his head	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0005.flac	christian what does this mean	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0006.flac	then he took him to a large room that was full of dust for it had not been swept and interpreter told his man to sweep it	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0007.flac	christian what means this	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0008.flac	then you next saw the maid come in to lay the dust so is sin made clean and laid low by faith in the book	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0009.flac	just as christian came up to the cross his load slid from his back close to the mouth of the tomb where it fell in and i saw it no more	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0010.flac	as he stood thus and wept lo three bright ones came to him and one of them said peace be to thee thou hast grace from thy sins	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0011.flac	christian gave three leaps for joy and sang as he went ah what a place is this blest cross blest tomb	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0012.flac	he went on thus till he came to a vale where he saw three men who were in a sound sleep with chains on their feet	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0013.flac	christian sirs whence come you and where do you go	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0014.flac	formalist and hypocrisy we were born in the land of vain glory and are on our way to mount zion for praise	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0015.flac	know you not that he that comes not in at the door but climbs up to get in the same is a thief	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0016.flac	they told christian that he had no need for care on that score for long use had made it law and they could prove that it had been so for years	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0017.flac	yes said they no doubt of it	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0018.flac	and if we get in the road at all pray what are the odds	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0019.flac	is not our case as good as yours	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0020.flac	i saw then that they all went on till they came to the foot of the hill of difficulty where there was a spring	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0021.flac	now when christian got as far as the spring of life he drank of it and then went up the hill	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0022.flac	now half way up was a cave made by the lord of that hill that those who came by might rest there	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0023.flac	timorous said that zion was the hill they meant to climb but that when they had got half way they found that they met with more and more risk so that great fear came on them and all they could do was to turn back	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0024.flac	yes said mistrust for just in front of us there lay two beasts of prey in our path we knew not if they slept or not but we thought that they would fall on us and tear our limbs	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0025.flac	yet he thought once more of what he had heard from the men and then he felt in his cloak for his scroll that he might read it and find some peace	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0026.flac	he felt for it but found it not	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0027.flac	so he fell down on his knees to pray that god would give him grace for this act and then went back to look for his scroll	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0028.flac	oh fool that i am said he to sleep in the day time so to give way to the flesh as to use for ease that rest which the lord of the hill had made but for the help of the soul	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0029.flac	such was the lot of the jews for their sin they were sent back by the way of the red sea and i am made to tread those steps with grief which i might have trod with joy had it not been for this sleep	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0030.flac	how far might i have been on my way by this time	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0031.flac	now by this time he had come to the vale once more where for a spell he sat down and wept but at last as he cast a sad glance at the foot of the bench he saw his scroll which he caught up with haste and put in his cloak	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0032.flac	words are too weak to tell the joy of christian when he had got back his scroll	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0033.flac	he laid it up in the breast of his coat and gave thanks to god	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0034.flac	with what a light step did he now climb the hill	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0035.flac	ah thought he these beasts range in the night for their prey and if they should meet with me in the dark how should i fly from them	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0036.flac	the name of the man who kept the lodge of that house was watchful and when he saw that christian made a halt as if he would go back he came out to him and said is thy strength so small	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0037.flac	fear not the two wild beasts for they are bound by chains and are put here to try the faith of those that have it and to find out those that have none	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0038.flac	keep in the midst of the path and no harm shall come to thee	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0039.flac	then i saw in my dream that still he went on in great dread of the wild beasts he heard them roar yet they did him no harm but when he had gone by them he went on with joy till he came and stood in front of the lodge where watchful dwelt	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0040.flac	christian sir what house is this may i rest here to night	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0041.flac	when watchful told her why christian had come there she said what is your name	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0042.flac	then christian bent down his head and went with them to the house	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0043.flac	piety come good christian since our love prompts us to take you in to rest let us talk with you of all that you have seen on your way	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0044.flac	christian with a right good will and i am glad that you should ask it of me	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0045.flac	prudence and first say what is it that makes you wish so much to go to mount zion	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0046.flac	there they say is no death and there i shall dwell with such as love the lord	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0047.flac	charity have you a wife and babes christian yes i have	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0048.flac	charity and why did you not bring them with you	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0049.flac	but they would not come with me nor have me leave them	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0050.flac	thus did christian talk with these friends till it grew dark and then he took his rest in a large room the name of which was peace there he slept till break of day and then he sang a hymn	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0051.flac	and they brought out the jaw bone of an ass with which samson did such great feats and the sling and stone with which david slew goliath of gath	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0052.flac	what is the name of this land said christian	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0053.flac	then they told him it was immanuels land	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0000.flac	more than this he hath been heard to rail on you my lord who are now his judge	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0001.flac	judge thy just doom would be to die on the spot still let us hear what thou hast to say	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0002.flac	then the judge to sum up the case spoke thus you see this man who has made such a stir in our town	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0003.flac	thus while one lost his life for the truth a new man rose from his death to tread the same way with christian	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0004.flac	come good hopeful said christian let us walk on the grass	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0005.flac	so they set off through the field	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0006.flac	hopeful i had my fears from the first and so gave you a hint christian good friend i grieve that i have brought you out of the right path	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0007.flac	hopeful say no more no doubt it is for our good	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0008.flac	christian we must not stand thus let us try to go back	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0009.flac	then said giant despair you have no right to force your way in here the ground on which you lie is mine	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0010.flac	they had not much to say as they knew that they were in fault	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0011.flac	and by this act we kill our souls as well	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0000.flac	four whether in that state man would have been master over men	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0001.flac	therefore in the state of innocence man had no mastership of the animals	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0002.flac	therefore in the state of innocence before man had disobeyed nothing disobeyed him that was naturally subject to him	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0003.flac	secondly this is proved by the order of divine providence which always governs inferior things by the superior	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0004.flac	thirdly this is proved from a property of man and of other animals	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0005.flac	now whatever is participated is subject to what is essential and universal	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0006.flac	therefore the subjection of other animals to man is proved to be natural	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0007.flac	they would not however on this account have been excepted from the mastership of man as neither at present are they for that reason excepted from the mastership of god whose providence has ordained all this	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0008.flac	this is signified by the fact that god led the animals to man that he might give them names expressive of their respective natures	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0009.flac	so all animals would have obeyed man of their own accord as in the present state some domestic animals obey him	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0010.flac	objection one it would seem that in the state of innocence man would not have had mastership over all other creatures	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0011.flac	much less therefore would it have obeyed man in the state of innocence	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0012.flac	therefore since it is by his reason that man is competent to have mastership it seems that in the state of innocence man had no dominion over plants	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0013.flac	now in man reason has the position of a master and not of a subject	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0014.flac	i answer that we must needs admit that in the primitive state there would have been some inequality at least as regards sex because generation depends upon diversity of sex and likewise as regards age for some would have been born of others nor would sexual union have been sterile	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0015.flac	there might also have been bodily disparity	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0016.flac	inequality might also arise on the part of nature as above described without any defect of nature	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0017.flac	objection one it would seem that in the state of innocence man would not have been master over man	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0018.flac	therefore in the state of innocence man would not have been subject to man	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0019.flac	in another sense mastership is referred in a general sense to any kind of subject and in this sense even he who has the office of governing and directing free men can be called a master	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0020.flac	such a kind of mastership would have existed in the state of innocence between man and man for two reasons	7697
dev-other/7697/245715/7697-245715-0000.flac	but in the state of innocence there would have been no weakness of old age	7697
dev-other/7697/245715/7697-245715-0001.flac	on the contrary everything generated is first imperfect but in the state of innocence children would have been begotten by generation	7697
dev-other/7697/245715/7697-245715-0002.flac	therefore from the first they would have been imperfect in bodily size and power	7697
dev-other/7697/245715/7697-245715-0003.flac	therefore in the state of innocence there was no need for women to be born on the contrary natures process in generation would have been in harmony with the manner in which it was established by god	7697
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0000.flac	i have been told that mister van brandt is in prison for debt i said	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0001.flac	and i saw for myself last night that he had left you helpless	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0002.flac	he left me the little money he had with him when he was arrested she rejoined sadly	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0003.flac	his cruel creditors are more to blame than he is for the poverty that has fallen on us	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0004.flac	even this negative defense of van brandt stung me to the quick i ought to have spoken more guardedly of him i said bitterly	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0005.flac	i ought to have remembered that a woman can forgive almost any wrong that a man can inflict on her when he is the man whom she loves	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0006.flac	she put her hand on my mouth and stopped me before i could say any more	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0007.flac	how can you speak so cruelly to me she asked	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0008.flac	you know to my shame i confessed it to you the last time we met you know that my heart in secret is all yours	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0009.flac	what wrong are you talking of	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0010.flac	is it the wrong i suffered when van brandt married me with a wife living at the time and living still	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0011.flac	do you think i can ever forget the great misfortune of my life the misfortune that has made me unworthy of you	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0012.flac	it is no fault of mine god knows but it is not the less true that i am not married and that the little darling who is playing out there with her doll is my child	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0013.flac	and you talk of my being your wife knowing that the child accepts me as her second father i said	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0014.flac	it would be better and happier for us both if you had as little pride as the child pride she repeated	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0015.flac	in such a position as mine	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0016.flac	a helpless woman with a mock husband in prison for debt	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0017.flac	am i to marry you for my food and shelter	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0018.flac	am i to marry you because there is no lawful tie that binds me to the father of my child	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0019.flac	bad as he is he has not forsaken me he has been forced away	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0020.flac	my only friend is it possible that you think me ungrateful enough to consent to be your wife	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0021.flac	the woman in my situation must be heartless indeed who could destroy your place in the estimation of the world and the regard of your friends	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0022.flac	the wretchedest creature that walks the streets would shrink from treating you in that way	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0023.flac	oh what are men made of	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0024.flac	how can you how can you speak of it	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0025.flac	i yielded and spoke of it no more	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0026.flac	every word she uttered only increased my admiration of the noble creature whom i had loved and lost	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0027.flac	bitterly as i hated the man who had parted us i loved her dearly enough to be even capable of helping him for her sake hopeless infatuation	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0028.flac	i dont deny it i dont excuse it hopeless infatuation you have forgiven me i said	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0029.flac	let me deserve to be forgiven	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0030.flac	it is something to be your only friend	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0031.flac	you must have plans for the future tell me unreservedly how i can help you	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0032.flac	complete the good work that you have begun she answered gratefully help me back to health	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0033.flac	make me strong enough to submit to a doctors estimate of my chances of living for some years yet	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0034.flac	a doctors estimate of your chances of living i repeated what do you mean	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0035.flac	i hardly know how to tell you she said without speaking again of mister van brandt	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0036.flac	does speaking of him again mean speaking of his debts i asked	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0037.flac	why need you hesitate	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0038.flac	you know that there is nothing i will not do to relieve your anxieties	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0039.flac	never let me tell you the plain truth	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0040.flac	there is a serious necessity for his getting out of prison	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0041.flac	yes this is his position in two words a little while since he obtained an excellent offer of employment abroad from a rich relative of his and he had made all his arrangements to accept it	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0042.flac	unhappily he returned to tell me of his good fortune and the same day he was arrested for debt	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0043.flac	the snare that had been set for her was plainly revealed in those four words	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0044.flac	in the eye of the law she was of course a single woman she was of age she was to all intents and purposes her own mistress	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0045.flac	what was there to prevent her from insuring her life if she pleased and from so disposing of the insurance as to give van brandt a direct interest in her death	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0046.flac	thanks to the happy accident of my position the one certain way of protecting her lay easily within my reach	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0047.flac	i could offer to lend the scoundrel the money that he wanted at an hours notice and he was the man to accept my proposal quite as easily as i could make it	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0048.flac	you are quite mistaken i replied	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0049.flac	i am only doubting whether your plan for relieving mister van brandt of his embarrassments is quite so simple as you suppose	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0050.flac	are you aware of the delays that are likely to take place before it will be possible to borrow money on your policy of insurance	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0051.flac	i know nothing about it she said sadly	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0052.flac	will you let me ask the advice of my lawyers	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0053.flac	they are trustworthy and experienced men and i am sure they can be of use to you	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0054.flac	cautiously as i had expressed myself her delicacy took the alarm	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0055.flac	promise that you wont ask me to borrow money of you for mister van brandt she rejoined and i will accept your help gratefully	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0056.flac	i could honestly promise that	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0057.flac	my one chance of saving her lay in keeping from her knowledge the course that i had now determined to pursue	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0058.flac	i rose to go while my resolution still sustained me	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0059.flac	kiss me she whispered before you go	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0060.flac	it is only your goodness that overpowers me	8173
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0000.flac	the next day everybody in the house began to make preparations for the journey	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0001.flac	everything was done very leisurely though there was a lot of talking and disputing and the giving of contrary orders	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0002.flac	the old porter was there directing and scolding the servants as they piled the rugs and blankets and bags of food and pots and pans and dishes into the wagon	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0003.flac	there was quite a procession when at last the big wagon rumbled out through the gateway	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0004.flac	behind it came the grandmother in her dhoolie dak a sort of a litter or easy chair swung between two long poles	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0005.flac	besides the family there were many servants and several others walked beside the slow moving wagon	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0006.flac	the cook too went with them	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0007.flac	good bye shouted little nao from his garden wall as they went by good bye	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0008.flac	they shouted greetings to their friend the potter as they passed him and also to the old fakir smeared all over with ashes who sat in a little brick hut by the bridge and pretended to make wonderful cures	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0009.flac	this is more fun than going to school said chola as the oxen plodded along through clouds of dust	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0010.flac	these lovely birds are found nearly everywhere in india and in some parts run quite wild	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0011.flac	his long matted hair hung on his shoulders and he was saying his prayers with the help of a rosary of beads which he continually passed through his hands	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0012.flac	as the wagon came up a young man who accompanied the holy man ran up and held out a begging bowl saying give oh charitable people to this holy one	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0013.flac	no country in the world has so many beggars as india	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0014.flac	many of them are called holy men because they do nothing but make pilgrimages from one sacred place to another living solely on the alms that are given to them	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0015.flac	when they had eaten their lunch the young people went to explore the garden near them	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0016.flac	perhaps there are dogs said mahala a little fearfully but they forgot about dogs when they saw a thicket of sugar cane down by a stream	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0017.flac	perhaps we can buy some from the man there he is now ploughing by the stream said chola	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0018.flac	it is looking for water said the farmer as he took a long stalk of cane and gently guided it down to the stream	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0019.flac	the snake is another sacred animal of the hindus and they would not kill or injure one for anything	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0020.flac	as they were about to move on again they saw a great cloud of dust down the road	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0021.flac	it turned out that it was a great and powerful rajah going in state on a journey to visit another rajah or ruler of one of the small kingdoms or states of which modern india was formerly made up	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0022.flac	first there came a big elephant all decorated with silk and gold and silver	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0023.flac	on the elephants back was a howdah which is like a big chair with a canopy over it and in this sitting cross legged was the rajah a big fat fellow dressed in coloured silks and jewels with a great diamond set plume in his turban	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0024.flac	behind the howdah stood a servant holding a big umbrella of fine feathers over the rajahs head	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0025.flac	the driver sat on the neck of the elephant and guided the big beast by prodding him on one side or the other with an iron shod stick or goad	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0026.flac	isnt it fine to ride like that on a big elephant	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0027.flac	and all the rest of the day the little folk talked of nothing but the great rajah and his escort	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0028.flac	our party came to a halt among many other bullock carts the owners of which were already sitting around on the ground cooking their suppers or bargaining for food at the little booths	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0029.flac	these they used for plates heaping them up with their boiled rice and curry and fish and all sorts of puddings and sweets	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0030.flac	as supper was being eaten another party stopped at the parao and camped not far away	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0031.flac	when the litter was put down a young boy stepped out looking very proud and haughty	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0032.flac	his servants at once spread a handsome rug on the ground for him to sit on and rushed about waiting on him taking good care to keep every one at a distance	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0033.flac	yes and how he orders every one about him	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0034.flac	around the little brahmins neck was a thin cord or thread which was the sign of his high caste	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0035.flac	meanwhile the haughty little brahmin ate his supper with his head turned away so no one could see him eat and then growing tired of respectful glances of the crowd around him he got into his litter again and the servants fastened the curtains tightly around him	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0036.flac	everybody slept soundly in spite of the fact that one of the servants was beating a drum most of the night which they really believed was the way to keep off evil spirits	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0037.flac	oh the thieves he cried	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0038.flac	they are as bad as the beggars	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0039.flac	what art thou guarding so carefully shriya asked her brother	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0040.flac	he and chola were walking beside the wagon for a change	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0041.flac	the lattices were raised so shriya and her mother and aunt could enjoy the fresh air	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0042.flac	they are my dolls said the little girl sadly as she patted the bundle beside her	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0043.flac	i take them as an offering to the holy river poor little woman	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0044.flac	must thou sacrifice thy toys too	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0045.flac	smiled her uncle as he patted her head	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0000.flac	chapter forty nine griggs is stubborn	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0001.flac	the days glided by with the stiffness in chris lees limbs growing less painful and the pony recovering fast for the clear mountain air seemed to act like a cure for wounds	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0002.flac	every day that came showed the injured animal in better condition	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0003.flac	its efforts to move no longer made chris wince and forget his own pains in those he felt at seeing the mustang suffer	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0004.flac	every one was busy for the keeping watch regularly took up a good deal of time	8254

dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0029.flac	being shot at by fellows with bows and arrows sounds bad enough but theres not much risk here	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0030.flac	i dont know about that said chris anxiously	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0031.flac	dont you well i do	8254

dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0036.flac	yes my lad but i want them to be planted farther back still	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0037.flac	im afraid father will say that the ponies ought to be close at hand	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0038.flac	yes thats right if it can be done but it would go hard with us all if the indians gave up the bait of the trap and turned upon those who set it	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0039.flac	well you must talk it over with father said chris	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0040.flac	too many redskins about as i told you	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0041.flac	there are always too many redskins about cried chris impatiently	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0042.flac	i wish we could charge them boldly and send them flying over the plains	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0043.flac	never to come back again said ned sharply	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0044.flac	not quite my lads dont you see that were playing a very ticklish game	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0045.flac	just then the doctor came into the shelter where the boys had been talking bringing with him wilton who had been shooting or rather trying to shoot for he had had no success and they too were talking earnestly about ways and means	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0046.flac	oh here you are griggs cried the doctor	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0047.flac	had a good turn at scouting yes sir	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0048.flac	the indians have shifted their quarters and theyre in about as awkward a position as they could contrive for our purpose	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0049.flac	we must get away from here to some good hunting ground	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0050.flac	do the indians seem to be camping or only on the move	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0051.flac	they seem to me to be hatching up some dodge or another replied griggs	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0052.flac	then he began to walk up and down slowly evidently deep in thought	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0053.flac	there he said ive made up my mind	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0054.flac	it is very evident that we may wait here till our stores are exhausted and be as far off the opportunity we seek as ever	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0055.flac	the indians can wait we cannot and they seem to know it	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0056.flac	going to give up young chriss plan said griggs slowly	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0057.flac	no im going to put it in force at once we start to night	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0058.flac	but all the same we can be making our preparations	8254

dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0060.flac	provisions can be packed in our wallets in fact everything held ready for a start	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0061.flac	finally just at dusk the animals can be driven in for food and water and	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0062.flac	exactly replied the doctor	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0063.flac	but before any more is said griggs i want to offer you the opportunity to draw back	8254

dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0067.flac	there is a horrible side to it griggs	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0068.flac	would be if we let them get the better of us sir	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0069.flac	you mean the shutting up the enemy here to starve	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0070.flac	ejaculated griggs so sharply that the boys started serve em right if they did sir	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0071.flac	what business have they to want our scalps but we shouldnt shut them up to starve	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0072.flac	theyd have weeks of work before they could get their horses out but without horses theyd be out in a week	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0073.flac	starve nonsense	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0074.flac	but there i dont want to make speeches its all settled gentlemen	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0075.flac	but youve got to tell the lookout whats coming off	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0076.flac	now every one understands that he is to be ready without showing any watchful indian scout that there is something on the way	8254
dev-other/8288/274150/8288-274150-0000.flac	and again when the artist following malicornes advice was a little late in arriving and when saint aignan had been obliged to be absent for some time it was interesting to observe though no one witnessed them those moments of silence full of deep expression which united in one sigh two souls most disposed to understand each other and who by no means objected to the quiet meditation they enjoyed together	8288
dev-other/8288/274150/8288-274150-0001.flac	in a word malicorne philosopher that he was though he knew it not had learned how to inspire the king with an appetite in the midst of plenty and with desire in the assurance of possession	8288
dev-other/8288/274150/8288-274150-0002.flac	in this manner therefore without leaving her room and having no confidante she was able to return to her apartment thus removing by her appearance a little tardy perhaps the suspicions of the most determined skeptics	8288
dev-other/8288/274150/8288-274150-0003.flac	but the door remained closed and neither saint aignan nor the painter appeared nor did the hangings even move	8288
dev-other/8288/274150/8288-274150-0004.flac	go then dearest love said the king but return quickly	8288
dev-other/8288/274150/8288-274150-0005.flac	no no not to day sire	8288
dev-other/8288/274150/8288-274150-0006.flac	i knew but too well that you had not ceased to love me	8288
dev-other/8288/274150/8288-274150-0007.flac	la valliere with a gesture partly of extreme terror and partly as if invoking a blessing attempted to speak but could not articulate one word	8288
dev-other/8288/274150/8288-274150-0008.flac	at the moment however when the king threw himself on his knees a cry of utter despair rang through the corridor accompanied by the sound of retreating footsteps	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0000.flac	the captain sitting buried in his leathern armchair his spurs fixed in the floor his sword between his legs was reading a number of letters as he twisted his mustache	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0001.flac	dartagnan uttered a welcome full of pleasure when he perceived his friends son	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0002.flac	raoul my boy he said by what lucky accident does it happen that the king has recalled you	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0003.flac	these words did not sound agreeably in the young mans ears who as he seated himself replied upon my word i cannot tell you all that i know is i have come back hum	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0004.flac	that the king has not recalled you and you have returned	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0005.flac	i do not understand that at all	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0006.flac	raoul was already pale enough and he now began to turn his hat round and round in his hand	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0007.flac	what the deuce is the matter that you look as you do and what makes you so dumb	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0008.flac	said the captain do people nowadays assume that sort of airs in england	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0009.flac	i have been in england and came here again as lively as a chaffinch	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0010.flac	will you not say something	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0011.flac	i have too much to say	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0012.flac	ah how is your father	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0013.flac	forgive me my dear friend i was going to ask you that	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0014.flac	dartagnan increased the sharpness of his penetrating gaze which no secret was capable of resisting	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0015.flac	you are unhappy about something he said	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0016.flac	i am indeed and you know the reason very well monsieur dartagnan	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0017.flac	nay do not pretend to be astonished	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0018.flac	i am not pretending to be astonished my friend	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0019.flac	i have neither head nor arm do not despise but help me in two words i am the most wretched of living beings oh oh	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0020.flac	she is deceiving you said dartagnan not a muscle of whose face had moved those are big words who makes use of them	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0021.flac	every one ah	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0022.flac	if every one says so there must be some truth in it	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0023.flac	not for a friend for a son	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0024.flac	the deuce take it you are really ill from curiosity	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0025.flac	no it is not from curiosity it is from love	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0026.flac	good another big word	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0027.flac	i tell you i love louise to distraction	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0028.flac	well suppose it were only that	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0029.flac	no sensible man ever succeeded in making much of a brain when the head was turned	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0030.flac	i have completely lost my senses in the same way a hundred times in my life	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0031.flac	you would hear but you would not understand me you would understand but you would not obey me	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0032.flac	oh try try	8288

dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0034.flac	very good i should quarrel with you	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0035.flac	i never complain as you know but as heaven and my father would never forgive me for blowing out my brains i will go and get the first person i meet to give me the information which you withhold i will tell him he lies and and you would kill him	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0036.flac	and a fine affair that would be so much the better what should i care	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0037.flac	you now assume a different tone instead of killing you will get killed yourself i suppose you mean very fine indeed	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0038.flac	how much i should regret you	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0039.flac	of course i should go about all day saying ah	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0040.flac	what a fine stupid fellow that bragelonne was	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0041.flac	as great a stupid as i ever met with	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0042.flac	go then raoul go and get yourself disposed of if you like	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0043.flac	i hardly know who can have taught you logic but deuce take me if your father has not been regularly robbed of his money	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0044.flac	raoul buried his face in his hands murmuring no no i have not a single friend in the world	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0045.flac	idle fancies monsieur i do not laugh at you although i am a gascon	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0046.flac	a carpenter what do you mean	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0047.flac	upon my word i dont know some one told me there was a carpenter who made an opening through a certain flooring	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0048.flac	oh i dont know where	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0049.flac	in whose room then	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0050.flac	i have told you for the last hour that i know nothing of the whole affair	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0051.flac	but the painter then the portrait	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0052.flac	why you seem to have only that name in your mouth	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0053.flac	i do not suppose it will concern you	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0054.flac	yes you are right and he made a step or two as if he were going to leave where are you going	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0055.flac	to look for some one who will tell me the truth	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0056.flac	who is that a woman	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0057.flac	you wish to be consoled by some one and you will be so at once she will tell you nothing ill of herself of course so be off	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0058.flac	you are mistaken monsieur replied raoul the woman i mean will tell me all the evil she possibly can	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0059.flac	well i admit it	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0060.flac	and in point of fact why should i play with you as a cat does with a poor mouse	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0061.flac	you distress me you do indeed	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0062.flac	wait if you can	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0063.flac	i cannot so much the worse	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0064.flac	ah said raoul snatching eagerly at the pen which the captain held out to him	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0065.flac	how very fortunate that is he was looking for you too	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0066.flac	she said in the same tone of voice it is not i who am going to speak to him who then	8288
