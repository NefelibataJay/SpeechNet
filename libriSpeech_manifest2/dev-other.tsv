dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0000.flac	as i approached the city i heard bells ringing and a little later i found the streets astir with throngs of well dressed people in family groups wending their way hither and thither	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0001.flac	looking about me i saw a gentleman in a neat black dress smiling and his hand extended to me with great cordiality	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0002.flac	he must have realized i was a stranger and wished to tender his hospitality to me i accepted it gratefully i clasped his hand he pressed mine	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0003.flac	we gazed for a moment silently into each others eyes	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0004.flac	of course you are going there too i said to my friendly guide	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0005.flac	yes he answered i conduct the worship i am a priest	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0006.flac	an idol i whispered taken by surprise	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0007.flac	they worshipped gods that did not exist	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0008.flac	but the greeks loved their gods i protested my heart clamoring in my breast	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0009.flac	no i said in a low voice	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0010.flac	he was an idol then and not a god	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0011.flac	it made athens a city of light it created the beautiful the true the good yes our religion was divine	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0012.flac	it had only one fault interrupted my guide what was that	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0013.flac	i inquired without knowing what his answer would be it was not true	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0014.flac	produce him	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0015.flac	i whispered to myself what blasphemy	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0016.flac	then taking heart i told my guide how more than once i had felt apollos radiant presence in my heart and told him of the immortal lines of homer concerning the divine apollo	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0017.flac	do you doubt homer	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0018.flac	i said to him homer the inspired bard	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0019.flac	no no apollo is not an idol	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0020.flac	he is a god and the son of a god	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0021.flac	the air was heavy with incense a number of men in gorgeous vestments were passing to and fro bowing and kneeling before the various lights and images	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0022.flac	observing my anxiety to understand the meaning of all this my guide took me aside and in a whisper told me that the people were celebrating the anniversary of the birthday of their beautiful savior jesus the son of god	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0023.flac	forget apollo he said with a suggestion of severity in his voice	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0024.flac	there is no such person he was only an idol	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0025.flac	if you were to search for apollo in all the universe you would never find any one answering to his name or description	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0026.flac	i want to see jesus i hastened turning toward him	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0027.flac	will he not be here this morning	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0028.flac	will he not speak to his worshippers i asked again	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0029.flac	will he not permit them to touch him to caress his hand to clasp his divine feet to inhale the ambrosial fragrance of his breath to bask in the golden light of his eyes to hear the music of his immaculate accents	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0030.flac	i asked my eyes filled with wonder and my voice quivering with excitement	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0031.flac	would not that then i ventured to ask impatiently make jesus as much of an idol as apollo	116
dev-other/116/288045/116-288045-0032.flac	and if faith that jesus is a god proves him a god why will not faith in apollo make him a god	116
dev-other/116/288046/116-288046-0000.flac	but i am determined not only to know if it is possible the whole truth about jesus but also to communicate that truth to others	116
dev-other/116/288046/116-288046-0001.flac	but there is more of a moral tonic in the open and candid discussion of a subject like the one in hand than in a multitude of platitudes	116
dev-other/116/288046/116-288046-0002.flac	i never deliver a lecture in which i do not either directly or indirectly give full and free expression to my faith in everything that is worthy of faith	116
dev-other/116/288046/116-288046-0003.flac	if i do not believe in dogma it is because i believe in freedom	116
dev-other/116/288046/116-288046-0004.flac	oh he tears down but does not build up is another criticism about my work it is not true	116
dev-other/116/288046/116-288046-0005.flac	no preacher or priest is more constructive	116
dev-other/116/288046/116-288046-0006.flac	clapping truth into jail gagging the mouth of the student is that building up or tearing down	116
dev-other/116/288046/116-288046-0007.flac	when bruno lighted a new torch to increase the light of the world what was his reward the stake	116
dev-other/116/288046/116-288046-0008.flac	count your rights political religious social intellectual and tell me which of them was conquered for you by the priest	116
dev-other/116/288046/116-288046-0009.flac	i wish to tell you something	116
dev-other/116/288046/116-288046-0010.flac	but first let us be impersonal the epithets irreverent blasphemer atheist and infidel are flung at a man not from pity but from envy	116
dev-other/116/288046/116-288046-0011.flac	not having the courage or the industry of our neighbor who works like a busy bee in the world of men and books searching with the sweat of his brow for the real bread of life wetting the open page before him with his tears pushing into the wee hours of the night his quest animated by the fairest of all loves the love of truth we ease our own indolent conscience by calling him names	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0000.flac	a myth is a fanciful explanation of a given phenomenon	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0001.flac	the mind craves for knowledge the child asks questions because of an inborn desire to know	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0002.flac	now and then they came close enough to snap at each other	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0003.flac	with this mythus the primitive man was satisfied until his developing intelligence realized its inadequacy science was born of that realization	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0004.flac	the myth of a one eyed people living in india has been replaced by accurate information concerning the hindoos	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0005.flac	and this is precisely the use to which myths have been put	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0006.flac	is jesus a myth	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0007.flac	there is in man a faculty for fiction	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0008.flac	it thinks less than it guesses	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0009.flac	it is reflection which introduces a bit into the mouth of imagination curbing its pace and subduing its restless spirit	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0010.flac	we fill the space about and over us with spirits fairies gods and other invisible and airy beings	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0011.flac	we covet the rainbow we reach out for the moon	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0012.flac	our feet do not really begin to touch the firm ground until we have reached the years of discretion	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0013.flac	science was not born until man had matured	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0014.flac	grown up people create science	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0015.flac	the cradle is the womb of all the fairies and faiths of mankind	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0016.flac	the school is the birthplace of science	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0017.flac	religion is the science of the child	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0018.flac	in the discussion of this subject i appeal to the mature not to the child mind	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0019.flac	he is gods mouthpiece and no one may disagree with him	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0020.flac	the only way i may command your respect is to be reasonable	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0021.flac	let us place ourselves entirely in the hands of the evidence	116
dev-other/116/288047/116-288047-0022.flac	as intelligent beings we desire to know whether this jesus whose worship is not only costing the world millions of the peoples money but which is also drawing to his service the time the energies the affection the devotion and the labor of humanity is a myth or a reality	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0000.flac	a number of other dates were observed by the christian church at various times as the birthday of jesus the gospels give no date and appear to be quite uncertain really ignorant about it	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0001.flac	yet there is no evidence that he was born on that day	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0002.flac	why this discrepancy in a historical document to say nothing about inspiration	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0003.flac	again matthew says that to escape the evil designs of herod mary and joseph with the infant jesus fled into egypt luke says nothing about this hurried flight nor of herods intention to kill the infant messiah	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0004.flac	when we come to the more important chapters about jesus we meet with greater difficulties	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0005.flac	while it is always on a friday that the crucifixion is commemorated the week in which the day occurs varies from year to year	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0006.flac	good friday falls not before the spring equinox but as soon after the spring equinox as the full moon allows thus making the calculation to depend upon the position of the sun in the zodiac and the phases of the moon	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0007.flac	the pagan oestera has become the christian easter	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0008.flac	but in the absence of evidence origin offers the following metaphysical arguments against the sceptical celsus one	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0009.flac	if we are to have any mythology at all he seems to argue why object to adding to it the mythus of jesus	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0010.flac	the immediate companions of jesus appear to be on the other hand as mythical as he is himself	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0011.flac	who was matthew who was mark	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0012.flac	who were john peter judas and mary	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0013.flac	there is absolutely no evidence that they ever existed	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0014.flac	if peter ever went to rome with a new doctrine how is it that no historian has taken note of him	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0015.flac	here again we see the presence of a myth	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0016.flac	he was the only one who saw them	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0017.flac	peter paul john james judas occupy the stage almost exclusively	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0018.flac	it is impossible to explain why the contemporaries of jesus the authors and historians of his time do not take notice of him	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0019.flac	could they have been in a conspiracy against him	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0020.flac	how else is this unanimous silence to be accounted for	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0021.flac	how then are we to decide which of the numerous candidates for divine honors should be given our votes	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0022.flac	and such a faith is never free it is always maintained by the sword now and by hell fire hereafter	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0023.flac	yet the most impossible utterances are put in jesus mouth	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0024.flac	only a mythical jesus could virtually hand over the government of the universe to courtiers who have petitions to press upon his attention	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0025.flac	moreover if jesus could keep his promise there would be today no misery in the world no orphans no childless mothers no shipwrecks no floods no famines no disease no crippled children no insanity no wars no crime no wrong	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0026.flac	have these prayers been answered	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0027.flac	how many self deluded prophets these extravagant claims have produced	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0028.flac	and who can number the bitter disappointments caused by such impossible promises	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0029.flac	the same which the preachers of today give he parried his answer with many words and at length said that the promise was to be taken with the provision that what we asked for would be given if god thought it for our good	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0030.flac	but he said if ye ask anything in my name i will do it and if it were not so i would have told you	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0031.flac	did he not mean just what he said	116
dev-other/116/288048/116-288048-0032.flac	self effort and not prayer is the remedy against ignorance slavery poverty and moral degradation	116
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0000.flac	it was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing any great sense of incongruity when with impressible persons love becomes solicitousness hope sinks to misgiving and faith to hope when the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret at opportunities for ambition that have been passed by and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0001.flac	still to a close observer they are just as perceptible the difference is that their media of manifestation are less trite and familiar than such well known ones as the bursting of the buds or the fall of the leaf	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0002.flac	if anything could be darker than the sky it was the wall and if any thing could be gloomier than the wall it was the river beneath	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0003.flac	an indescribable succession of dull blows perplexing in their regularity sent their sound with difficulty through the fluffy atmosphere	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0004.flac	not long after a form moved by the brink of the river	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0005.flac	this was all that was positively discoverable though it seemed human	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0006.flac	the shape went slowly along but without much exertion for the snow though sudden was not as yet more than two inches deep	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0007.flac	at this time some words were spoken aloud one	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0008.flac	two three	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0009.flac	four five	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0010.flac	between each utterance the little shape advanced about half a dozen yards	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0011.flac	here the spot stopped and dwindled smaller	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0012.flac	then a morsel of snow flew across the river towards the fifth window	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0013.flac	the river would have been seen by day to be of that deep smooth sort which races middle and sides with the same gliding precision any irregularities of speed being immediately corrected by a small whirlpool	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0014.flac	the window was struck again in the same manner	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0015.flac	then a noise was heard apparently produced by the opening of the window	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0016.flac	said the blurred spot in the snow tremulously	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0017.flac	i asked which was your window forgive me	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0018.flac	well i said that you might	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0019.flac	o must i it is when shall we be married frank	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0020.flac	i have money	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0021.flac	and we live in two parishes do we what then	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0022.flac	if i said so of course i will	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0023.flac	the fact is i forgot to ask	1255
dev-other/1255/138279/1255-138279-0024.flac	good night frank good night	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0000.flac	things arrange themselves	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0001.flac	but the countess never gave way an inch	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0002.flac	the following was the answer which she returned to the note written to her by aunt julia	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0003.flac	i should not know how to drink wine with them and should do a hundred things which would make them think me a beast	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0004.flac	but the girl begged for some delay	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0005.flac	it was a matter that required to be considered	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0006.flac	pride in him might be as weak as pride in them	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0007.flac	if they would put out their hands to him why should he refuse to put out his own	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0008.flac	our tailor received him courteously having learned to like the man understanding that he had behaved with honesty and wisdom in regard to his client and respecting him as one of the workers of the day but he declared that for the lovel family as a family he did not care for them particularly	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0009.flac	they are poles asunder from me he said	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0010.flac	but by your good fortune and merit if you will allow me to say so you have travelled from the one pole very far towards the other	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0011.flac	at present i think that the sense of the country is in favour of an aristocracy of birth	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0012.flac	when you were foremost among them did you not wish to be their master	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0013.flac	it is one to which all legislative and all human efforts should and must tend	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0014.flac	when you make much water boil mister thwaite some of it will probably boil over	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0015.flac	i quite agree with you that the silk gowns should be kept for their elders and so the conversation was ended	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0016.flac	with her there was a real wish that the poles might be joined together by her future husband	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0017.flac	if you really wish it you shall go he said	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0018.flac	and a blue one to be married in alas me	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0019.flac	must i have a pink silk gown to walk about in early in the morning	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0020.flac	id sooner see you darning my worsted stockings sweetheart	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0021.flac	i can do that too	1255
dev-other/1255/74899/1255-74899-0022.flac	and now ill sit down and write a letter to my lord	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0000.flac	he hoped nothing serious had happened to drag her out at such an untoward time	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0001.flac	but as the rain gave not the least sign of cessation he observed i think we shall have to go back never	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0002.flac	why not he inquired	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0003.flac	i cannot understand how you should know me while i have no knowledge of you	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0004.flac	oh but you know me about me at least	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0005.flac	i should think so	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0006.flac	hes my father indeed	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0007.flac	but we have been tenants of sylvania castle on the island here this season	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0008.flac	my fathers is a comparatively humble residence hard by	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0009.flac	but he could afford a much bigger one if he chose	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0010.flac	you have heard so	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0011.flac	i dont know he doesnt tell me much of his affairs	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0012.flac	my father she burst out suddenly is always scolding me for my extravagance	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0013.flac	was that this evening	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0014.flac	and there on the nets they sat	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0015.flac	jocelyn thought it strange that he should be thrown by fate into a position to play the son of the montagues to this daughter of the capulets	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0016.flac	no i shall go on and get a lodging in budmouth town if ever i reach it	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0017.flac	it is so late that there will be no house open except a little place near the station where you wont care to stay	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0018.flac	the island was an island still	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0019.flac	they had not realized the force of the elements till now	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0020.flac	he steadied her bodily by encircling her waist with his arm and she made no objection	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0021.flac	he pitied her and while he wondered at it admired her determination	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0022.flac	their application for admission led to the withdrawal of a bolt and they stood within the gaslight of the passage	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0023.flac	he could see now that though she was such a fine figure quite as tall as himself she was but in the bloom of young womanhood	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0024.flac	i will tell the servant to do this and send you up something to eat	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0025.flac	he felt ravenously hungry himself and set about drying his clothes as well as he could and eating at the same time	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0026.flac	by the aid of some temporary wraps and some slippers from the cupboard he was contriving to make himself comfortable when the maid servant came downstairs with a damp armful of womans raiment	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0027.flac	you are sleepy my girl said pierston	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0028.flac	he again became conscious of the change which had been initiated during the walk	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0029.flac	the well beloved was moving house had gone over to the wearer of this attire	1255
dev-other/1255/90407/1255-90407-0030.flac	and how about little avice caro	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0000.flac	she draws close and satisfies	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0001.flac	he could not forget missus pine avons eyes though he remembered nothing of her other facial details	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0002.flac	afterwards they kept apart awhile in the drawing room for forms sake but eventually gravitated together again and finished the evening in each others company	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0003.flac	but this was not all	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0004.flac	but was he able	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0005.flac	it was unfair to go further without telling her even though hitherto such explicitness had not been absolutely demanded	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0006.flac	he determined to call immediately on the new incarnation	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0007.flac	she lived not far from the long fashionable hamptonshire square and he went thither with expectations of having a highly emotional time at least	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0008.flac	but somehow the very bell pull seemed cold although she had so earnestly asked him to come	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0009.flac	raising her eyes in a slightly inquiring manner from the book she was reading she leant back in the chair as if soaking herself in luxurious sensations which had nothing to do with him and replied to his greeting with a few commonplace words	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0010.flac	just as they turn madeira into port in the space of a single night so this old air has been taken and doctored and twisted about and brought out as a new popular ditty indeed	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0011.flac	she thawed a little and then they went on to talk about her house which had been newly painted and decorated with greenish blue satin up to the height of a persons head an arrangement that somewhat improved her slightly faded though still pretty face and was helped by the awnings over the windows	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0012.flac	yes i have had my house some years she observed complacently and i like it better every year	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0013.flac	dont you feel lonely in it sometimes o never	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0014.flac	what an uncivil thing to say she murmured in surprise	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0015.flac	it is rather uncivil	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0016.flac	as a punishment she did not ring the bell but left him to find his way out as he could	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0017.flac	i saw him at lady channelcliffes the other night	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0018.flac	jocelyn pierston	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0019.flac	o didnt he marry her	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0020.flac	said missus pine avon with a start	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0021.flac	but jocelyn was receding from the pretty widows house with long strides	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0022.flac	lady iris had left the drawing room for a moment to see that all was right in the dining room and when he was shown in there stood alone in the lamplight nichola pine avon	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0023.flac	she had been the first arrival	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0024.flac	as the other guests dropped in the pair retreated into a shady corner and she talked beside him till all moved off for the eating and drinking	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0025.flac	he had not been appointed to take her across to the dining room but at the table found her exactly opposite	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0026.flac	the spring in the present case was the artistic commendation she deserved and craved	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0027.flac	the lady on jocelyns left wife of a lord justice of appeal was in like manner talking to her companion on the outer side so that for the time he was left to himself	1255
dev-other/1255/90413/1255-90413-0028.flac	it came from the wife of one of his fathers former workmen and was concerning her son whom she begged jocelyn to recommend as candidate for some post in town that she wished him to fill	1255
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0000.flac	what is necessary to the completeness of the story at this stage is not to recapitulate but to take up some of the loose ends of threads woven in and follow them through until the clear and comprehensive picture of events can be seen	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0001.flac	the way of the inventor is hard	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0002.flac	he can sometimes raise capital to help him in working out his crude conceptions but even then it is frequently done at a distressful cost of personal surrender	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0003.flac	when the result is achieved the invention makes its appeal on the score of economy of material or of effort and then labor often awaits with crushing and tyrannical spirit to smash the apparatus or forbid its very use	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0004.flac	possibly our national optimism as revealed in invention the seeking a higher good needs some check	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0005.flac	possibly the leaders would travel too fast and too far on the road to perfection if conservatism did not also play its salutary part in insisting that the procession move forward as a whole	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0006.flac	on the contrary the conditions for its acceptance had been ripening fast	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0007.flac	yet the very vogue of the electric arc light made harder the arrival of the incandescent	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0008.flac	a number of parent arc lighting companies were in existence and a great many local companies had been called into being under franchises for commercial business and to execute regular city contracts for street lighting	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0009.flac	thus in a curious manner the modern art of electric lighting was in a very true sense divided against itself with intense rivalries and jealousies which were none the less real because they were but temporary and occurred in a field where ultimate union of forces was inevitable	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0010.flac	hence twenty years after the first edison stations were established the methods they involved could be fairly credited with no less than sixty seven per cent	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0011.flac	it will be readily understood that under these conditions the modern lighting company supplies to its customers both incandescent and arc lighting frequently from the same dynamo electric machinery as a source of current and that the old feud as between the rival systems has died out	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0012.flac	in fact for some years past the presidents of the national electric light association have been chosen almost exclusively from among the managers of the great edison lighting companies in the leading cities	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0013.flac	the other strong opposition to the incandescent light came from the gas industry	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0014.flac	there also the most bitter feeling was shown	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0015.flac	the gas manager did not like the arc light but it interfered only with his street service which was not his largest source of income by any means	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0016.flac	here again was given a most convincing demonstration of the truth that such an addition to the resources of mankind always carries with it unsuspected benefits even for its enemies	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0017.flac	this was not long nor universally the spirit shown and to day in hundreds of cities the electric and gas properties are united under the one management which does not find it impossible to push in a friendly and progressive way the use of both illuminants	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0018.flac	the most conspicuous example of this identity of interest is given in new york itself	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0019.flac	so much for the early opposition of which there was plenty	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0020.flac	but it may be questioned whether inertia is not equally to be dreaded with active ill will	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0021.flac	of course a great many accounts were written and read but while genuine interest was aroused it was necessarily apathetic	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0022.flac	we got it at a great bargain and only paid a small sum down and the balance on mortgage	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0023.flac	we sold them for forty cents but there were only about twenty or thirty thousand of them	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0024.flac	the fourth year i got it down to thirty seven cents and i made all the money up in one year that i had lost previously	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0025.flac	one of the incidents which caused a very great cheapening was that when we started one of the important processes had to be done by experts	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0026.flac	after feeling around for some days i got a clew how to do it	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0027.flac	i then made another machine which did the work nicely	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0028.flac	incidentally it may be noted as illustrative of the problems brought to edison that while he had the factory at harrison an importer in the chinese trade went to him and wanted a dynamo to be run by hand power	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0029.flac	for making the dynamos edison secured as noted in the preceding chapter the roach iron works on goerck street new york and this was also equipped	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0030.flac	to sigmund bergmann who had worked previously with edison on telephone apparatus and phonographs and was already making edison specialties in a small way in a loft on wooster street new york was assigned the task of constructing sockets fixtures meters safety fuses and numerous other details	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0031.flac	in the early part of eighteen eighty one the edison electric light company leased the old bishop mansion at sixty five fifth avenue close to fourteenth street for its headquarters and show rooms	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0032.flac	this was one of the finest homes in the city of that period and its acquisition was a premonitory sign of the surrender of the famous residential avenue to commerce	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0033.flac	the experience with the little gas engine was rather startling	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0034.flac	one day it was not going very well and i went down to the man in charge and got exploring around	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0035.flac	for the next four or five years sixty five was a veritable beehive day and night	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0036.flac	the routine was very much the same as that at the laboratory in its utter neglect of the clock	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0037.flac	i was telling a gentleman one day that i could not keep a cigar even if i locked them up in my desk they would break it open	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0038.flac	he suggested to me that he had a friend over on eighth avenue who made a superior grade of cigars and who would show them a trick	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0039.flac	he said he would have some of them made up with hair and old paper and i could put them in without a word and see the result	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0040.flac	i thought no more about the matter	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0041.flac	i didnt remember anything about it	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0042.flac	i was too busy on other things to notice	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0043.flac	speaking of those days or nights edison says years ago one of the great violinists was remenyi	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0044.flac	he would talk with me but i never asked him to bring his violin	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0045.flac	one night he came with his violin about twelve oclock	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0046.flac	after that every time he came to new york he used to call at sixty five late at night with his violin	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0047.flac	another visitor who used to give us a good deal of amusement and pleasure was captain shaw the head of the london fire brigade	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0048.flac	he would go out among the fire laddies and have a great time	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0049.flac	speaking of telling stories i once got telling a man stories at the harrison lamp factory in the yard as he was leaving	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0050.flac	it was winter and he was all in furs	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0051.flac	i had nothing on to protect me against the cold	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0052.flac	then i got pleurisy and had to be shipped to florida for cure	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0053.flac	it had merely enjoyed the delights of anxious anticipation and the perilous pleasure of backing edisons experiments	1585
dev-other/1585/131718/1585-131718-0054.flac	now active exploitation was required	1585

dev-other/1585/157660/1585-157660-0002.flac	standing on a broken column of the old steeple three hundred feet above primrose hill william struck an attitude of theatrical fashion and uttered the following oratorical flight	1585
dev-other/1585/157660/1585-157660-0003.flac	glorious london	1585
dev-other/1585/157660/1585-157660-0004.flac	sad how sad to think that the day will come when not a vestige of this wonderful mass of human energy shall remain where the cry of the wolf bat and bittern shall only be heard and nature again resume her rustic splendid desolation	1585
dev-other/1585/157660/1585-157660-0005.flac	the devils tavern was a resort for actors authors bohemians lords and ladies who did not retire early to their downy couches	1585
dev-other/1585/157660/1585-157660-0006.flac	william and myself soon found rest in deep slumber and wafted away into a dreamless realm our tired bodies lay in the enfolding arms of morpheus until the porter knocked at our door the next morning as the clock of the tower struck the hour of nine	1585

dev-other/1585/157660/1585-157660-0010.flac	william to the great amazement of the dealer flung a guinea in the center pot which was immediately tapped by jack while the others looked on in silent expectation	1585
dev-other/1585/157660/1585-157660-0011.flac	the polite jack replied all right sir take your word for it	1585
dev-other/1585/157660/1585-157660-0012.flac	i have set my life upon a cast and will stand the hazard of the die	1585
dev-other/1585/157660/1585-157660-0013.flac	i immediately followed in his footsteps and found him joking with the landlady about a couple of infant bull pups she was fondling in her capacious lap	1585
dev-other/1585/157660/1585-157660-0014.flac	if he had dropped out of the clouds william could not have been more pleased or surprised and the feeling was reciprocal	1585

dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0000.flac	in my recent travels in the west i have felt that out there freedom as an idea has become feeble and ineffectual	1630
dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0001.flac	the same thing is happening now with the people of the west	1630
dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0002.flac	they are flattered into believing that they are free and they have the sovereign power in their hands	1630
dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0003.flac	thus it has become more and more evident to me that the ideal of freedom has grown tenuous in the atmosphere of the west	1630
dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0004.flac	the mentality is that of a slave owning community with a mutilated multitude of men tied to its commercial and political treadmill	1630
dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0005.flac	he who cares to have slaves must chain himself to them he who builds walls to create exclusion for others builds walls across his own freedom he who distrusts freedom in others loses his moral right to it	1630

dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0010.flac	the organic unity of a varied and elastic society gave way to a conventional order which proved its artificial character by its inexorable law of exclusion	1630
dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0011.flac	life has its inequalities i admit but they are natural and are in harmony with our vital functions	1630
dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0012.flac	by squeezing human beings in the grip of an inelastic system and forcibly holding them fixed we have ignored the laws of life and growth	1630

dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0015.flac	they will be incapable of holding a just freedom in politics and of fighting in freedoms cause	1630
dev-other/1630/102884/1630-102884-0016.flac	it represents the active aspect of inertia which has the appearance of freedom but not its truth and therefore gives rise to slavery both within its boundaries and outside	1630

dev-other/1630/141772/1630-141772-0012.flac	a splendid reply said napoleon	1630
dev-other/1630/141772/1630-141772-0013.flac	prince andrew who had also been brought forward before the emperors eyes to complete the show of prisoners could not fail to attract his attention	1630
dev-other/1630/141772/1630-141772-0014.flac	his face shone with self satisfaction and pleasure	1630
dev-other/1630/141772/1630-141772-0015.flac	the soldiers who had carried prince andrew had noticed and taken the little gold icon princess mary had hung round her brothers neck but seeing the favor the emperor showed the prisoners they now hastened to return the holy image	1630
dev-other/1630/141772/1630-141772-0016.flac	prince andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced but the little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest outside his uniform	1630

dev-other/1630/73710/1630-73710-0002.flac	it makes the heart ache but to picture such vicissitudes to the imagination	1630
dev-other/1630/73710/1630-73710-0003.flac	the knowledge that such changes can occur flits over the mind like the thought of death obscuring all our gay fancies with its bat like wing and tainting the healthy atmosphere of our happiness with its venomous expirations	1630

dev-other/1630/96099/1630-96099-0010.flac	i had no fear of him not till the very last when he played me this evil turn	1630
dev-other/1630/96099/1630-96099-0011.flac	i suspected nothing when he brought out his pocketbook it was stuffed full monsieur i saw that and my confidence increased called for the reckoning and paid with an italian bank note	1630

dev-other/1630/96099/1630-96099-0013.flac	he went out monsieur and piff paff he was no more to be seen	1630
dev-other/1630/96099/1630-96099-0014.flac	why let him out of your sight	1630
dev-other/1630/96099/1630-96099-0015.flac	it was only now at the eleventh hour that the italian had become inculpated and the question of his possible anxiety to escape had never been considered	1630
dev-other/1630/96099/1630-96099-0016.flac	he left everything behind	1630
dev-other/1630/96099/1630-96099-0017.flac	hand it me said the chief and when it came into his hands he began to turn over the leaves hurriedly	1630
dev-other/1630/96099/1630-96099-0018.flac	i do not understand not more than a word here and there	1630
dev-other/1630/96099/1630-96099-0019.flac	it is no doubt italian	1630
dev-other/1630/96099/1630-96099-0020.flac	of course such a consummate ass as you have proved yourself would not think of searching the restaurant or the immediate neighbourhood or of making inquiries as to whether he had been seen or as to which way he had gone	1630
dev-other/1630/96099/1630-96099-0021.flac	it was a note for a hundred lire a hundred francs and the restaurant bill was no more than seventeen francs hah	1630
dev-other/1630/96099/1630-96099-0022.flac	he was much pressed in a great hurry	1630
dev-other/1630/96099/1630-96099-0023.flac	directly he crossed the threshold he called the first cab and was driving away but he was stopped the devil	1630
dev-other/1630/96099/1630-96099-0024.flac	he wished to pass on to leave her she would not consent then they both got into the cab and were driven away together	1630
dev-other/1650/157641/1650-157641-0000.flac	the social attitude towards smoking in early victorian days and for some time later was curious	1650
dev-other/1650/157641/1650-157641-0001.flac	now missus quilp he says i feel in a smoking humour and shall probably blaze away all night	1650
dev-other/1650/157641/1650-157641-0002.flac	but sit where you are if you please in case i want you	1650
dev-other/1650/157641/1650-157641-0003.flac	the dwarfs tastes however were catholic	1650
dev-other/1650/157641/1650-157641-0004.flac	but quilp and brass were not in society	1650
dev-other/1650/157641/1650-157641-0005.flac	there were still plenty of active opponents and denouncers of tobacco	1650
dev-other/1650/157641/1650-157641-0006.flac	one of the most distinguished was the great duke of wellington who abominated smoking and was annoyed by the increase of cigar smoking among officers of the army	1650
dev-other/1650/157641/1650-157641-0007.flac	the ladies had a keen scent for the abominable odour of tobacco and distrusted the men who smoked	1650
dev-other/1650/157641/1650-157641-0008.flac	here is fitz boodles or thackerays comment on it what is this smoking that it should be considered a crime	1650
dev-other/1650/157641/1650-157641-0009.flac	i believe in my heart that women are jealous of it as of a rival	1650
dev-other/1650/157641/1650-157641-0010.flac	i would lay a guinea that many a lady who has just been kind enough to read the above lines lays down the book after this confession of mine that i am a smoker and says oh the vulgar wretch and passes on to something else	1650
dev-other/1650/157641/1650-157641-0011.flac	germany has been puffing for three score years france smokes to a man	1650
dev-other/1650/157641/1650-157641-0012.flac	psha look at his progress	1650
dev-other/1650/157641/1650-157641-0013.flac	thus the odour of tobacco was not brought into the drawing room	1650
dev-other/1650/157641/1650-157641-0014.flac	the journalists and bohemians who met at the cogers were above or below the dictates of fashion and smoking was always a feature of their gatherings	1650
dev-other/1650/157641/1650-157641-0015.flac	both queen victoria and the prince consort detested it so tobacco was taboo wherever the court was	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0000.flac	the officers were about to take leave but prince andrew apparently reluctant to be left alone with his friend asked them to stay and have tea	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0001.flac	seats were brought in and so was the tea	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0002.flac	the officers gazed with surprise at pierres huge stout figure and listened to his talk of moscow and the position of our army round which he had ridden	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0003.flac	so you understand the whole position of our troops	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0004.flac	not being a military man i cant say i have understood it fully but i understand the general position	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0005.flac	well then you know more than anyone else be it who it may said prince andrew	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0006.flac	and tell me your opinion of barclay de tolly	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0007.flac	pierre looked at timokhin with the condescendingly interrogative smile with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0008.flac	we see light again since his serenity has been appointed your excellency said timokhin timidly and continually turning to glance at his colonel	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0009.flac	why so asked pierre	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0010.flac	then why was it forbidden	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0011.flac	at smolensk too he judged correctly that the french might outflank us as they had larger forces	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0012.flac	he ordered us to retreat and all our efforts and losses went for nothing	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0013.flac	so it has been with barclay	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0014.flac	while russia was well a foreigner could serve her and be a splendid minister but as soon as she is in danger she needs one of her own kin	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0015.flac	and they say hes a skillful commander rejoined pierre	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0016.flac	i dont understand what is meant by a skillful commander replied prince andrew ironically	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0017.flac	a skillful commander replied pierre	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0018.flac	pierre looked at him in surprise	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0019.flac	and yet they say that war is like a game of chess he remarked	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0020.flac	the relative strength of bodies of troops can never be known to anyone	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0021.flac	success never depends and never will depend on position or equipment or even on numbers and least of all on position but on what then	1650
dev-other/1650/167613/1650-167613-0022.flac	on the feeling that is in me and in him he pointed to timokhin and in each soldier	1650

dev-other/1651/136854/1651-136854-0029.flac	no thirty two on patience even under extreme misery is wonderfully lofty and as much above the rant of stoicism as the sun of revelation is brighter than the twilight of pagan philosophy	1651
dev-other/1651/136854/1651-136854-0030.flac	it must indeed be allowed that the structure of his sentences is expanded and often has somewhat of the inversion of latin and that he delighted to express familiar thoughts in philosophical language being in this the reverse of socrates who it was said reduced philosophy to the simplicity of common life	1651
dev-other/1651/136854/1651-136854-0031.flac	this idle charge has been echoed from one babbler to another who have confounded johnsons essays with johnsons dictionary and because he thought it right in a lexicon of our language to collect many words which had fallen into disuse but were supported by great authorities it has been imagined that all of these have been interwoven into his own compositions	1651

dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0003.flac	here was she disturbed and unhappy because her instinct had made anything but a refusal impossible while he not many minutes after he had met with a rejection of what ought to have been the deepest holiest proposal of his life could speak as if briefs success and all its superficial consequences of a good house clever and agreeable society were the sole avowed objects of his desires oh dear	1686

dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0012.flac	but she soon felt it was not about anything which having only lately and suddenly occurred could have given rise to any complicated thoughts that her father wished to speak to her	1686
dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0013.flac	mister hale did not answer for a minute or two	1686

dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0018.flac	it was all the worse for being so mysterious	1686
dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0019.flac	why can you no longer be a clergyman	1686
dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0020.flac	surely if the bishop were told all we know about frederick and the hard unjust	1686

dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0025.flac	margaret sighed as if standing on the verge of some new horror	1686

dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0028.flac	margaret could not tell what to say it seemed to her as terribly mysterious as if her father were about to turn mahometan	1686
dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0029.flac	the one staid foundation of her home of her idea of her beloved father seemed reeling and rocking	1686
dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0030.flac	he swallowed down the dry choking sobs which had been heaving up from his heart hitherto and going to his bookcase he took down a volume which he had often been reading lately and from which he thought he had derived strength to enter upon the course in which he was now embarked	1686

dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0034.flac	as he read this and glanced at much more which he did not read he gained resolution for himself and felt as if he too could be brave and firm in doing what he believed to be right but as he ceased he heard margarets low convulsive sob and his courage sank down under the keen sense of suffering	1686
dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0035.flac	i have borne long with self reproach that would have roused any mind less torpid and cowardly than mine	1686

dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0037.flac	margaret i tried to do it i tried to content myself with simply refusing the additional preferment and stopping quietly here strangling my conscience now as i had strained it before	1686

dev-other/1686/142278/1686-142278-0039.flac	he rose and walked up and down the room speaking low words of self reproach and humiliation of which margaret was thankful to hear but few	1686

dev-other/1701/141759/1701-141759-0019.flac	now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero would it be right to remind him of herself and as it might seem of the obligations to her he had taken on himself	1701

dev-other/1701/141759/1701-141759-0026.flac	the count put his ear to the keyhole and listened	1701
dev-other/1701/141759/1701-141759-0027.flac	at first he heard the sound of indifferent voices then anna mikhaylovnas voice alone in a long speech then a cry then silence then both voices together with glad intonations and then footsteps	1701
dev-other/1701/141759/1701-141759-0028.flac	anna mikhaylovna opened the door	1701
dev-other/1701/141759/1701-141759-0029.flac	when she heard this sonya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and unable to bear the looks turned upon her ran away into the dancing hall whirled round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon and flushed and smiling plumped down on the floor	1701
dev-other/1701/141759/1701-141759-0030.flac	the countess was crying	1701
dev-other/1701/141759/1701-141759-0031.flac	from all he says one should be glad and not cry	1701

dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0022.flac	berg put on the cleanest of coats without a spot or speck of dust stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards in the way affected by the emperor alexander and having assured himself from the way rostov looked at it that his coat had been noticed left the room with a pleasant smile	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0023.flac	oh dear what a beast i am muttered rostov as he read the letter why	1701

dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0027.flac	it is some letter of recommendation what the devil do i want it for	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0028.flac	he looked intently and inquiringly into his friends eyes evidently trying in vain to find the answer to some question	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0029.flac	would you believe it count i was not at all alarmed because i knew i was right	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0030.flac	i came forward berg stood up and showed how he presented himself with his hand to his cap and really it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and self complacency than his did	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0031.flac	well he stormed at me as the saying is stormed and stormed and stormed	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0032.flac	it was not a matter of life but rather of death as the saying is	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0033.flac	albanians and devils and to siberia said berg with a sagacious smile	1701

dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0035.flac	the next day it was not even mentioned in the orders of the day	1701

dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0038.flac	rostov was a truthful young man and would on no account have told a deliberate lie	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0039.flac	he began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened but imperceptibly involuntarily and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0040.flac	prince andrew who liked to help young men was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed toward boris who had managed to please him the day before he wished to do what the young man wanted	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0041.flac	in spite of prince andrews disagreeable ironical tone in spite of the contempt with which rostov from his fighting army point of view regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently one rostov felt confused blushed and became silent	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0042.flac	boris inquired what news there might be on the staff and what without indiscretion one might ask about our plans	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0043.flac	we shall probably advance replied bolkonski evidently reluctant to say more in the presence of a stranger	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0044.flac	berg took the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as was rumored the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0045.flac	i was there said rostov angrily as if intending to insult the aide de camp	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0046.flac	with a slightly contemptuous smile he said yes there are many stories now told about that affair	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0047.flac	but our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemys fire	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0048.flac	our stories have some weight not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0049.flac	however he added rising you know my name and where to find me but dont forget that i do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted and as a man older than you my advice is to let the matter drop	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0050.flac	exclaimed prince andrew and with a bow to them both he went out	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0051.flac	and he was still more angry at having omitted to say it	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0052.flac	he ordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave of boris rode home	1701
dev-other/1701/141760/1701-141760-0053.flac	should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected adjutant or really let the matter drop was the question that worried him all the way	1701
dev-other/2506/11267/2506-11267-0000.flac	i see shoals of them depart not perhaps without an innate longing too to quit the island along with those happy snobs	2506

dev-other/2506/11267/2506-11267-0005.flac	my lady marchioness comes on board looks round with that happy air of mingled terror and impertinence which distinguishes her ladyship and rushes to her carriage for it is impossible that she should mingle with the other snobs on deck	2506
dev-other/2506/11267/2506-11267-0006.flac	there she sits and will be ill in private	2506

dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0000.flac	when a gross instance of snobbishness happens why should not the indignant journalist call the public attention to that delinquency too	2506
dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0001.flac	how for instance could that wonderful case of the earl of mangelwurzel and his brother be examined in the snobbish point of view	2506
dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0002.flac	all we require is that a man should be recommended to us by the earl of mangelwurzelshire	2506

dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0009.flac	finally there was the case of the right honourable mister vernon at york	2506
dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0010.flac	the right honourable was the son of a nobleman and practised on an old lady	2506
dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0011.flac	then he cast his nets over a family of father mother and daughters one of whom he proposed to marry	2506

dev-other/2506/11278/2506-11278-0013.flac	it was the right honourable which baited the hook which gorged all these greedy simple snobs	2506

dev-other/2506/169427/2506-169427-0000.flac	interest however still runs on in both cases the periodical or accidental payments of it just serving to keep the memory of the affair alive till at length in some evil hour pop comes the creditor upon each and by demanding principal upon the spot together with full interest to the very day makes them both feel the full extent of their obligations	2506
dev-other/2506/169427/2506-169427-0001.flac	as the reader for i hate your ifs has a thorough knowledge of human nature i need not say more to satisfy him that my hero could not go on at this rate without some slight experience of these incidental mementos	2506
dev-other/2506/169427/2506-169427-0002.flac	to speak the truth he had wantonly involved himself in a multitude of small book debts of this stamp which notwithstanding eugeniuss frequent advice he too much disregarded thinking that as not one of them was contracted thro any malignancy but on the contrary from an honesty of mind and a mere jocundity of humour they would all of them be crossd out in course	2506
dev-other/2506/169427/2506-169427-0003.flac	eugenius would never admit this and would often tell him that one day or other he would certainly be reckoned with and he would often add in an accent of sorrowful apprehension to the uttermost mite	2506
dev-other/2506/169427/2506-169427-0004.flac	what inclined eugenius to the same opinion was as follows	2506
dev-other/2506/169427/2506-169427-0005.flac	yorick followed eugenius with his eyes to the door he then closed them and never opened them more	2506
dev-other/2506/169427/2506-169427-0006.flac	alas poor yorick	2506
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0000.flac	now this is how arthur hunted the stag	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0001.flac	and the last dog that was let loose was the favorite dog of arthur cavall was his name	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0002.flac	then they sounded the death horn for slaying and they all gathered round	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0003.flac	one wished that it should be given to the lady best beloved by him and another to the lady whom he loved best	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0004.flac	and after midday they beheld an unshapely little man upon a horse and after him a dame or a damsel also on horseback and after her a knight of large stature bowed down and hanging his head low and sorrowfully and clad in broken and worthless armor	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0005.flac	i know not who they are said he but i know said guenever this is the knight whom geraint pursued and methinks that he comes not here by his own free will	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0006.flac	but geraint has overtaken him and avenged the insult to the maiden to the uttermost	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0007.flac	lady said he at the gate there is a knight and i saw never a man of so pitiful an aspect to look upon as he	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0008.flac	i do said he he tells me that he is edeyrn the son of nudd	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0009.flac	then she replied i know him not	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0010.flac	so guenever went to the gate to meet him and he entered	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0011.flac	and geraint greets thee well and in greeting thee he compelled me to come hither to do thy pleasure for the insult which thy maiden received from the dwarf now where did he overtake thee	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0012.flac	sir said she when thinkest thou that geraint will be here	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0013.flac	to morrow lady i think he will be here with the maiden	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0014.flac	i am lord said he and i have met with much trouble and received wounds unsupportable	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0015.flac	well said arthur from what i hear it behooves guenever to be merciful towards thee	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0016.flac	the mercy which thou desirest lord said she will i grant to him since it is as insulting to thee that an insult should be offered to me as to thyself	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0017.flac	thus will it be best to do said arthur let this man have medical care until it be known whether he may live	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0018.flac	to guenever and her handmaidens said he	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0019.flac	and the steward of the household so ordered her	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0020.flac	and being young he changed himself and grew to hate the sin that seemd so like his own of modred arthurs nephew and fell at last in the great battle fighting for the king	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0021.flac	and when geraint came to the place where guenever was he saluted her	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0022.flac	then they went in and dismounted	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0023.flac	heaven protect thee said arthur and the welcome of heaven be unto thee	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0024.flac	and inasmuch as thou hast vanquished edeyrn the son of nudd thou hast had a prosperous career	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0025.flac	and from that time she became his wife	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0026.flac	and the maiden took up her abode in the palace and she had many companions both men and women and there was no maiden more esteemed than she in the island of britain	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0027.flac	and a year and a second and a third he proceeded thus until his fame had flown over the face of the kingdom	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0028.flac	and he greets thee well as an uncle should greet his nephew and as a vassal should greet his lord	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0029.flac	and the neighboring chiefs knowing this grow insolent towards him and covet his land and possessions	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0030.flac	and arthur told geraint the cause of the mission and of the coming of the ambassadors to him out of cornwall truly said geraint be it to my advantage or disadvantage lord i will do according to thy will concerning this embassy	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0031.flac	what discourse said guenever do i hear between you	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0032.flac	said geraint i think i shall have enough of knighthood with me and they set forth	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0033.flac	and never was there seen a fairer host journeying towards the severn	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0034.flac	and he said to geraint i am a feeble and an aged man and whilst i was able to maintain the dominion for thee and for myself i did so	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0035.flac	and every one asked that which he desired	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0036.flac	and they were not long in giving so eager was every one to bestow gifts and of those who came to ask gifts none departed unsatisfied	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0037.flac	then geraint sent ambassadors to the men of cornwall to ask them this	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0038.flac	and they all said that it would be the fulness of joy and honor to them for geraint to come and receive their homage	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0039.flac	so he received the homage of such as were there	3660
dev-other/3660/172182/3660-172182-0040.flac	and the day after the followers of arthur intended to go away	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0000.flac	geraint as he had been used to do when he was at arthurs court frequented tournaments	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0001.flac	before geraint the scourge of the enemy i saw steeds white with foam and after the shout of battle a fearful torrent	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0002.flac	these tidings came to erbin	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0003.flac	not i by my confession unto heaven said she there is nothing more hateful unto me than this	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0004.flac	and the tears she shed and the words she had spoken awoke him	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0005.flac	and evil betide me said he if thou returnest here until thou knowest whether i have lost my strength so completely as thou didst say	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0006.flac	then geraint went to see erbin	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0007.flac	sir said he i am going upon a quest and i am not certain when i may come back	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0008.flac	take heed therefore unto thy possessions until my return	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0009.flac	but one person only will go with me	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0010.flac	and he desired enid to mount her horse and to ride forward and to keep a long way before him	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0011.flac	and unless i speak unto thee say not thou one word either	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0012.flac	and though thou shouldst desire to see my defeat and my death by the hands of those men yet do i feel no dread	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0013.flac	and he received him and that not feebly	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0014.flac	and say not one word unto me unless i speak first unto thee	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0015.flac	i will do as far as i can lord said she according to thy desire	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0016.flac	ah maiden said he it is vain to attempt proceeding forward	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0017.flac	i cannot by any means refrain from sleep through weariness said he do thou therefore watch the horses and sleep not	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0018.flac	and when she saw the dawn of day appear she looked around her to see if he were waking and thereupon he woke	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0019.flac	and they left the wood and they came to an open country with meadows on one hand and mowers mowing the meadows	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0020.flac	my lord he added will it be displeasing to thee if i ask whence thou comest also	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0021.flac	wilt thou follow my counsel said the youth and take thy meal from me	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0022.flac	what sort of meal he inquired	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0023.flac	then they washed and took their repast	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0024.flac	i go now lord said he to meet the knight and to conduct him to his lodging	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0025.flac	i will do lord said she as thou sayest	3660
dev-other/3660/172183/3660-172183-0026.flac	and after they had eaten and drank geraint went to sleep and so did enid also	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0000.flac	the dates seem unimportant but throughout the period the officers and men of the ship have been unremittingly busy	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0001.flac	bowers attacked the ships stores surveyed relisted and restowed them saving very much space by unstowing numerous cases and stowing the contents in the lazarette	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0002.flac	without steam the leak can now be kept under with the hand pump by two daily efforts of a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0003.flac	as the ship was and in her present heavily laden condition it would certainly have taken three to four hours each day	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0004.flac	the large green tent was put up and proper supports made for it	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0005.flac	the engine room staff and andersons people on the engines scientists were stowing their laboratories the cook refitting his galley and so forth not a single spot but had its band of workers	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0006.flac	the mens space such as it is therefore extends from the fore hatch to the stem on the main deck	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0007.flac	under the forecastle are stalls for fifteen ponies the maximum the space would hold the narrow irregular space in front is packed tight with fodder	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0008.flac	immediately behind the forecastle bulkhead is the small booby hatch the only entrance to the mens mess deck in bad weather	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0009.flac	abaft the fore hatch is the ice house	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0010.flac	we managed to get three tons of ice one hundred sixty two carcases of mutton and three carcases of beef besides some boxes of sweetbreads and kidneys into this space	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0011.flac	the sacks containing this last added to the goods already mentioned make a really heavy deck cargo and one is naturally anxious concerning it but everything that can be done by lashing and securing has been done	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0012.flac	forage i originally ordered thirty tons of compressed oaten hay from melbourne	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0013.flac	the scene is wholly enchanting and such a view from some sheltered sunny corner in a garden which blazes with masses of red and golden flowers tends to feelings of inexpressible satisfaction with all things	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0014.flac	a great mass of people assembled	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0015.flac	k and i lunched with a party in the new zealand companys ship ruapehu	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0016.flac	telegram to say terra nova had arrived sunday night	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0017.flac	a third sledge stands across the break of the poop in the space hitherto occupied by the after winch	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0018.flac	the quantity is two and a half tons and the space occupied considerable	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0019.flac	the ship was over two feet by the stern but this will soon be remedied	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0020.flac	they must perforce be chained up and they are given what shelter is afforded on deck but their position is not enviable	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0021.flac	it is a pathetic attitude deeply significant of cold and misery occasionally some poor beast emits a long pathetic whine	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0022.flac	there are generally one or two on watch which eases matters but it is a squash	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0023.flac	later in the day the wind has veered to the westward heading us slightly	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0024.flac	oates and atkinson with intermittent assistance from others were busy keeping the ponies on their legs	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0025.flac	there was nothing for it but to grapple with the evil and nearly all hands were labouring for hours in the waist of the ship heaving coal sacks overboard and re lashing the petrol cases et cetera in the best manner possible under such difficult and dangerous circumstances	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0026.flac	no sooner was some semblance of order restored than some exceptionally heavy wave would tear away the lashing and the work had to be done all over again	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0027.flac	from this moment about four a m the engine room became the centre of interest	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0028.flac	the water gained in spite of every effort	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0029.flac	the outlook appeared grim	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0030.flac	the amount of water which was being made with the ship so roughly handled was most uncertain	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0031.flac	williams had to confess he was beaten and must draw fires what was to be done	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0032.flac	the bilge pump is dependent on the main engine	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0033.flac	on one occasion i was waist deep when standing on the rail of the poop	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0034.flac	the afterguard were organised in two parties by evans to work buckets the men were kept steadily going on the choked hand pumps this seemed all that could be done for the moment and what a measure to count as the sole safeguard of the ship from sinking practically an attempt to bale her out	3660
dev-other/3660/6517/3660-6517-0035.flac	occasionally a heavy sea would bear one of them away and he was only saved by his chain	3660
dev-other/3663/172005/3663-172005-0000.flac	the fawn had taken his morning meal and now lay curled up on a bed of moss	3663
dev-other/3663/172005/3663-172005-0001.flac	whenever the fawn caught up he was quite content to frisk about	3663
dev-other/3663/172005/3663-172005-0002.flac	the danger was certain now it was near	3663
dev-other/3663/172005/3663-172005-0003.flac	the hounds had struck her trail where she turned and the fawn was safe	3663
dev-other/3663/172005/3663-172005-0004.flac	one was rowing the other had a gun in his hand what should she do	3663
dev-other/3663/172005/3663-172005-0005.flac	her tired legs could not propel the tired body rapidly	3663
dev-other/3663/172005/3663-172005-0006.flac	the doe saw the boat nearing her	3663
dev-other/3663/172005/3663-172005-0007.flac	in a moment more the boat was on her and the man at the oars had leaned over and caught her	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0000.flac	i was tormented by thirst but had abstained from drinking for many days according to the doctors orders	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0001.flac	that old man ceased to give so much annoyance yet sometimes he appeared to me in dreams	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0002.flac	felice had given them orders not to speak to me of this	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0003.flac	this maid had stolen from me certain little things of some importance and in her fear of being detected she would have been very glad if i had died	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0004.flac	accordingly she allowed me twice to take as much as i could of the water so that in good earnest i swallowed more than a flask full one i then covered myself and began to sweat and fell into a deep sleep	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0005.flac	they say that my poor friend was on the point of falling to the ground so grieved was he to hear this	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0006.flac	afterwards he took an ugly stick and began to beat the serving girl with all his might shouting out ah traitress you have killed him for me then	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0007.flac	she may indeed have saved my life so lend me a helping hand for i have sweated and be quick about it	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0008.flac	felice recovered his spirits dried and made me comfortable and i being conscious of a great improvement in my state began to reckon on recovery	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0009.flac	just then the other doctor bernardino put in his appearance who at the beginning of my illness had refused to bleed me	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0010.flac	maestro francesco that most able man exclaimed oh power of nature	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0011.flac	she knows what she requires and the physicians know nothing	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0012.flac	that simpleton maestro bernardino made answer saying if he had drunk another bottle he would have been cured upon the spot	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0013.flac	afterwards he turned to me and asked if i could have drunk more water	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0014.flac	i answered no because i had entirely quenched my thirst	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0015.flac	in like manner she was asking for what she wanted when the poor young man begged you to bleed him	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0016.flac	if you knew that his recovery depended upon his drinking two flasks of water why did you not say so before	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0017.flac	you might then have boasted of his cure	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0018.flac	at these words the wretched quack sulkily departed and never showed his face again	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0019.flac	the very evening i was taken with great precautions in a chair well wrapped up and protected from the cold	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0020.flac	do not permit him any irregularities for though he has escaped this time another disorder now would be the death of him	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0021.flac	then he turned to me and said my benvenuto be prudent commit no excesses and when you are quite recovered i beg you to make me a madonna with your own hand and i will always pay my devotions to it for your sake	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0022.flac	so i made my mind up and prepared to travel	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0023.flac	that day many friends came to see me among others pier landi who was the best and dearest friend i ever had	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0024.flac	next day there came a certain niccolo da monte aguto who was also a very great friend of mine	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0025.flac	i had harboured him in rome and provided for his costs while he had turned my whole house upside down for the man was subject to a species of dry scab which he was always in the habit of scratching with his hands	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0026.flac	meanwhile that able physician francesco da monte varchi attended to my cure with great skill	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0027.flac	there they seated me to wait until the duke went by	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0028.flac	many of my friends at court came up to greet me and expressed surprise that i had undergone the inconvenience of being carried in that way while so shattered by illness they said that i ought to have waited till i was well and then to have visited the duke	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0029.flac	at these words maestro agostino the dukes tailor made his way through all those gentlemen and said if that is all you want to know you shall know it at this very moment	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0030.flac	giorgio the painter whom i have mentioned happened just then to pass and maestro agostino exclaimed there is the man who accused you now you know yourself if it be true or not	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0031.flac	as fiercely as i could not being able to leave my seat i asked giorgio if it was true that he had accused me	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0032.flac	he denied that it was so and that he had ever said anything of the sort	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0033.flac	maestro agostino retorted you gallows bird	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0034.flac	dont you know that i know it for most certain	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0035.flac	giorgio made off as quickly as he could repeating that he had not accused me	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0036.flac	then after a short while the duke came by whereupon i had myself raised up before his excellency and he halted	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0037.flac	the duke gazed at me and marvelled i was still alive afterwards he bade me take heed to be an honest man and regain my health	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0038.flac	when i reached home niccolo da monte aguto came to visit me and told me that i had escaped one of the most dreadful perils in the world quite contrary to all his expectations for he had seen my ruin written with indelible ink now i must make haste to get well and afterwards take french leave because my jeopardy came from a quarter and a man who was able to destroy me	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0039.flac	i answered that i had done nothing to displease him but that he had injured me and told him all the affair about the mint	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0040.flac	he repeated get hence as quickly as you can and be of good courage for you will see your vengeance executed sooner than you expect	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0041.flac	i the best attention to my health gave pietro pagolo advice about stamping the coins and then went off upon my way to rome without saying a word to the duke or anybody else	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0042.flac	you want them to immortalise that ferocious tyrant	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0043.flac	you have never made anything so exquisite which proves you our inveterate foe and their devoted friend and yet the pope and he have had it twice in mind to hang you without any fault of yours	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0044.flac	it was firmly believed that duke alessandro was the son of pope clement	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0045.flac	messer francesco used also to say and swear by all his saints that if he could he would have robbed me of the dies for that medal	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0046.flac	i responded that he had done well to tell me so and that i would take such care of them that he should never see them more	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0047.flac	i now sent to florence to request lorenzino that he would send me the reverse of the medal	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0048.flac	niccolo da monte aguto to whom i had written wrote back saying that he had spoken to that mad melancholy philosopher lorenzino for it he had replied that he was thinking night and day of nothing else and that he would finish it as soon as he was able	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0049.flac	nevertheless i was not to set my hopes upon his reverse but i had better invent one out of my own head and when i had finished it i might bring it without hesitation to the duke for this would be to my advantage	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0050.flac	i composed the design of a reverse which seemed to me appropriate and pressed the work forward to my best ability	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0051.flac	this being so as he was a fellow of much humour we used often to laugh together about the great credit he had gained	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0052.flac	i therefore dismounted at once got my fowling piece ready and at a very long range brought two of them down with a single ball	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0053.flac	i never used to shoot with more than one ball and was usually able to hit my mark at two hundred cubits which cannot be done by other ways of loading	3663
dev-other/3663/172528/3663-172528-0054.flac	i lifted my foot and let the water run out then when i had mounted we made haste for rome	3663
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0000.flac	we have succeeded in amassing two hundred ounces of silver enough i trust to erect a handsome bronze figure	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0001.flac	to be sure it seems a shame yet if i could steal the money this priest is boasting about i could live at ease for the rest of my days and so he began casting about how best he might compass his purpose	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0002.flac	but the priest far from guessing the drift of his comrades thoughts journeyed cheerfully on till they reached the town of kuana	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0003.flac	here there is an arm of the sea which is crossed in ferry boats that start as soon as some twenty or thirty passengers are gathered together and in one of these boats the two travellers embarked	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0004.flac	when the boatmen and passengers heard the splash and saw the priest struggling in the water they were afraid and made every effort to save him but the wind was fair and the boat running swiftly under the bellying sails so they were soon a few hundred yards off from the drowning man who sank before the boat could be turned to rescue him	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0005.flac	when he saw this the ronin feigned the utmost grief and dismay and said to his fellow passengers this priest whom we have just lost was my cousin he was going to kiyoto to visit the shrine of his patron and as i happened to have business there as well we settled to travel together	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0006.flac	now alas by this misfortune my cousin is dead and i am left alone	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0007.flac	he spoke so feelingly and wept so freely that the passengers believed his story and pitied and tried to comfort him	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0008.flac	then the ronin said to the boatmen	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0009.flac	what think you gentlemen added he turning to the other travellers	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0010.flac	they of course were only too glad to avoid any hindrance to their onward journey and all with one voice agreed to what the ronin had proposed and so the matter was settled	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0011.flac	when at length they reached the shore they left the boat and every man went his way but the ronin overjoyed in his heart took the wandering priests luggage and putting it with his own pursued his journey to kiyoto	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0012.flac	fortune favouring his speculations he began to amass great wealth and lived at his ease denying himself nothing and in course of time he married a wife who bore him a child	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0013.flac	since then all has gone well with me yet had i not been poor i had never turned assassin nor thief	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0014.flac	he would have fled into the house but the ghost stretched forth its withered arm and clutching the back of his neck scowled at him with a vindictive glare and a hideous ghastliness of mien so unspeakably awful that any ordinary man would have swooned with fear	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0015.flac	at length undone by such ceaseless vexation tokubei fell ill and kept muttering oh misery misery the wandering priest is coming to torture me	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0016.flac	now it chanced that the story reached the ears of a certain wandering priest who lodged in the next street	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0017.flac	and hiding his head under the coverlet he lay quivering all over	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0018.flac	three years ago at the kuana ferry you flung me into the water and well you remember it	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0019.flac	happily continued the priest i had learned to swim and to dive as a boy so i reached the shore and after wandering through many provinces succeeded in setting up a bronze figure to buddha thus fulfilling the wish of my heart	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0020.flac	on my journey homewards i took a lodging in the next street and there heard of your marvellous ailment	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0021.flac	thinking i could divine its cause i came to see you and am glad to find i was not mistaken	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0022.flac	and would it not ill become me to bear malice	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0023.flac	repent therefore and abandon your evil ways	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0024.flac	to see you do so i should esteem the height of happiness	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0025.flac	be of good cheer now and look me in the face and you will see that i am really a living man and no vengeful goblin come to torment you	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0026.flac	in a fit of madness i was tempted to kill and rob you	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0027.flac	fortune befriended me ever after but the richer i grew the more keenly i felt how wicked i had been and the more i foresaw that my victims vengeance would some day overtake me	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0028.flac	haunted by this thought i lost my nerve till one night i beheld your spirit and from that time forth fell ill	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0029.flac	but how you managed to escape and are still alive is more than i can understand	3915
dev-other/3915/57461/3915-57461-0030.flac	a guilty man said the priest with a smile shudders at the rustling of the wind or the chattering of a storks beak a murderers conscience preys upon his mind till he sees what is not	3915

dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0002.flac	these must be kept carefully by the mother as a safeguard against the many evils that beset child life	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0003.flac	visits to noted temples by relatives and friends often result in additions to the childs collection	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0004.flac	all these are put together by the careful mother and preserved as jealously as queen althea kept the charred stick that governed the destiny of her son	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0005.flac	as the children arrive at years of discretion these treasures pass out of the mothers faithful keeping into the hands of their actual owners and they are usually kept stored away in some little used drawer or cabinet until death removes the necessity for any further safeguards over life	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0006.flac	each animal brings its own kind of good or bad luck into the hour day or year over which it presides and only a skillful balancer of pros and cons can read aright the combinations and understand what the luck of any particular hour in any particular day of any particular year will be	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0007.flac	for the greater events of family life the home prophecies are felt to be too uncertain and the services of the fortune teller must be called in	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0008.flac	no well managed family would think of building a new house without finding in what direction to face the front door	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0009.flac	after this matter has been settled and the house is fairly begun there are occasional crises in its construction upon which much depends	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0010.flac	of these the most important is the day when the roof is raised	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0011.flac	the house owner then decides whether the day set by the builder is a lucky one for himself and his family	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0012.flac	a present of money to each workman is also in order and will conduce to the rapid and faithful execution of the job in hand when at last the house is finished and carpenters and plasterers are ready to leave it the local firemen who have assisted all along in the building as unskilled laborers often ascend to the roof and from the ridge pole cast down cakes for which the children of the neighborhood scramble joyfully	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0013.flac	all come who can and those who cannot come send servants or provisions	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0014.flac	on the day after the death often in the evening the body must be placed in the cask shaped coffin that until recently was the style commonly in use in japan	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0015.flac	now among the wealthier classes the long coffin has superseded the small square or round one but the smaller expense connected with burial in the old way makes the survival of the old type a necessity for the majority of japanese	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0016.flac	at an appointed time all the relatives assemble in the death chamber and preparations are made for the bathing of the corpse	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0017.flac	there is no official ceremonial mourning of parents for their children nor does custom require them to perform any of the last rites or attend the funeral	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0018.flac	upon the younger brothers and sisters falls the duty of attending to all the last sad ministrations	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0019.flac	when the body has been washed it is dressed in white in silk habutai whenever the family can afford it	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0020.flac	the body to be placed in the coffin must be folded into a sitting posture the chin resting upon the knees the position of the mummies found in many aboriginal american tombs	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0021.flac	this difficult to us apparently impossible feat safely accomplished there are placed in the coffin a number of small things that the dead takes with him to the next world	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0022.flac	the single exception to this rule about metal is that small copper coins may be put in to fee the old hag who guards the bank of the river of death	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0023.flac	last of all the vacant spaces in the coffin are filled in with bags of tea	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0024.flac	so long as the coffin is in the house it must be watched over continually	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0025.flac	it is their duty to see that the incense burning before the coffin is never allowed to go out while the food for the dead is renewed at regular intervals by the mourners themselves	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0026.flac	there are few enlightened japanese who will defend the present system of cruelty to the afflicted or who do not long for some change but so great is the force of conservatism in this regard so haunting the fear that any change may indicate a lack of respect for the dead that reform advances slowly	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0027.flac	individual instances occur in which some of the worst features of these customs are modified	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0028.flac	a case in point is that of the late mister fukuzawa a man whose life was devoted to the advancement of his countrymen in modern ways and who in his death continued his teaching	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0029.flac	in his will he provided that his body was to be buried without washing in the clothing in which he died	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0030.flac	through this growing feeling and the unselfishness of maternal affection may come in time the release from these mournful ceremonies	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0031.flac	just before the procession starts a religious ceremony is held at the house which is attended by the friends of the deceased and which is substantially the same as that performed at the cemetery	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0032.flac	on the day of the burial great bunches of natural flowers are sent to the dead each bunch so large as to require the services of one man to carry it	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0033.flac	sometimes with the gift a man is sent to take part in the procession but if the giver feels too poor to hire a man this burden too falls upon the bereaved household for etiquette requires that all flowers sent be borne to the grave by uniformed coolies who march in the funeral train	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0034.flac	another favorite present at this time among buddhists is a cage of living birds to be borne to the grave and released thereon	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0035.flac	it seems more like a bridal than a burial	3915
dev-other/3915/98647/3915-98647-0036.flac	during this period the spirit of the deceased is supposed to be still inhabiting the house and a tablet or shrine is set up in the death chamber before which food and flowers are renewed daily	3915
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0000.flac	he tarried at genishau a few days and came up to gardow where i then resided he was apparently without any business that would support him but he soon became acquainted with my son thomas with whom he hunted for a long time and made his home with him at my house winter came on and he continued his stay	4153
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0001.flac	the enraged husband well knowing that he should feel a blow if he waited to hear the order repeated instantly retreated and went down the river to his cattle	4153

dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0003.flac	the indians were soon answered by the american officer that the wampum was cordially accepted and that a continuance of peace was ardently wished for	4153

dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0007.flac	by running in the woods his clothing had become torn into rags so that he was in a suffering condition almost naked	4153
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0008.flac	allen made his trowsers himself and then built a raft on which he went down the river to his own place at mount morris	4153
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0009.flac	there an indian gave him some refreshment and a good gun with which he hastened on to little beards town where he found his squaw	4153
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0010.flac	not daring to risk himself at that place for fear of being given up he made her but a short visit and came immediately to gardow	4153
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0011.flac	the love of liberty however added to his natural swiftness gave him sufficient strength to make his escape to his former castle of safety	4153

dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0013.flac	still unsatisfied and doubting my veracity they advised my indian brother to use his influence to draw from me the secret of his concealment which they had an idea that i considered of great importance not only to him but to myself i persisted in my ignorance of his situation and finally they left me	4153
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0014.flac	he came to my house in the night and awoke me with the greatest caution fearing that some of his enemies might be watching to take him at a time when and in a place where it would be impossible for him to make his escape	4153
dev-other/4153/185072/4153-185072-0015.flac	at that time allen lay in a secret place in the gulph a short distance above my flats in a hole that he accidentally found in the rock near the river	4153

dev-other/4153/186222/4153-186222-0002.flac	beth hesitated	4153
dev-other/4153/186222/4153-186222-0003.flac	the letter asking me to visit her was the first i have ever received from her	4153
dev-other/4153/186222/4153-186222-0004.flac	but since she asked me to visit her we judged she had softened and might wish to become friendly and so i accepted the invitation	4153

dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0019.flac	the boy turned away but in a moment halted again	4153
dev-other/4153/186223/4153-186223-0020.flac	his interest in miss janes brother john was extraordinary	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0000.flac	they are but lukewarm lovers who can content themselves with a dialogue carried on at bowshot distance	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0001.flac	if there be an elysium on earth it is this	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0002.flac	his own daughter his only daughter of the best blood of southern aristocracy beautiful accomplished everything to secure him a splendid alliance holding nightly assignation with a horse hunter	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0003.flac	he could well concede so much to her caprice since her staying at home could be no disadvantage to the cause that had prompted him to the stern counsel	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0004.flac	it is already known that this road passed the hacienda of casa del corvo at some distance from the house and on the opposite side of the river	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0005.flac	on reaching the copse he dismounted led his horse in among the underwood hitched him by looping his bridle rein around the topmost twigs of an elastic bough then detaching a long rope of twisted horsehair from the horn of his saddle and inserting his arm into its coil he glided out to the edge of the island on that side that lay towards the hacienda	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0006.flac	before forsaking the shadow of the copse he cast a glance towards the sky and at the moon sailing supremely over it	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0007.flac	the droll conceit which has so oft amused the nocturnal inebriate of great cities appeared to produce a like affect upon the night patroller of the prairie and for a moment the shadow late darkening his brow disappeared	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0008.flac	its not likely at this hour unless it be the owner of a bad conscience who cant sleep	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0009.flac	troth theres one such within those walls	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0010.flac	if he be abroad theres a good chance of his seeing me on the open ground not that i should care a straw if it were only myself to be compromised	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0011.flac	its no use waiting upon the moon deuce take her	4153
dev-other/4153/61735/4153-61735-0012.flac	it is true he had designs upon the hacienda but these did not contemplate either its cash plate or jewellery if we except the most precious jewel it contained the mistress of the mansion herself	4153
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0000.flac	the church bells were ringing and people on the avenue going by to service turned curious inquiring looks up at the great house and then went on talking of the recent events which had so strangely entered into and made history in the city	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0001.flac	and all through his impassioned appeal this morning there was a note of sadness and rebuke and stern condemnation that made many of the members pale with self accusation or with inward anger	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0002.flac	raymond had voted to continue for another year the saloon	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0003.flac	the christians of raymond stood condemned by the result	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0004.flac	for that had been the fact in raymond for years the saloon ruled	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0005.flac	president marsh sat there his usual erect handsome firm bright self confident bearing all gone his head bowed upon his breast the great tears rolling down his cheeks unmindful of the fact that never before had he shown outward emotion in a public service	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0006.flac	what if he had begun to do as jesus would have done long ago	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0007.flac	when had the first church yielded to such a baptism of tears	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0008.flac	what had become of its regular precise conventional order of service undisturbed by any vulgar emotion and unmoved by any foolish excitement	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0009.flac	they had been living so long on their surface feelings that they had almost forgotten the deeper wells of life	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0010.flac	the meeting was tender it glowed with the spirits presence it was alive with strong and lasting resolve to begin a war on the whiskey power in raymond that would break its reign forever	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0011.flac	since the first sunday when the first company of volunteers had pledged themselves to do as jesus would do the different meetings had been characterized by distinct impulses or impressions	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0012.flac	and all through it ran one general cry for deliverance from the saloon and its awful curse	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0013.flac	gray and his wife were besieged by inquirers who wanted to know what loreens friends and acquaintances were expected to do in paying their last respects to her	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0014.flac	gray had gone up to virginias and after talking it over with her and maxwell the arrangement had been made	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0015.flac	i am and always have been opposed to large public funerals said gray whose complete wholesome simplicity of character was one of its great sources of strength but the cry of the poor creatures who knew loreen is so earnest that i do not know how to refuse this desire to see her and pay her poor body some last little honor what do you think mister maxwell	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0016.flac	i will be guided by your judgment in the matter	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0017.flac	i am sure that whatever you and miss page think best will be right	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0018.flac	under the circumstances i have a great distaste for what seems like display at such times but this seems different	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0019.flac	it happened that that afternoon a somewhat noted newspaper correspondent was passing through raymond on his way to an editorial convention in a neighboring city	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0020.flac	she was a common street drunkard and yet the services at the tent were as impressive as any i ever witnessed in a metropolitan church over the most distinguished citizen	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0021.flac	it struck me of course being a stranger in the place with considerable astonishment to hear voices like those one naturally expects to hear only in great churches or concerts at such a meeting as this	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0022.flac	mister maxwell spoke of the fact that the dead woman had been fully prepared to go but he spoke in a peculiarly sensitive manner of the effect of the liquor business on the lives of men and women like this one	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0023.flac	raymond of course being a railroad town and the centre of the great packing interests for this region is full of saloons	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0024.flac	then followed what was perhaps the queer part of this strange service	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0025.flac	it was one of the simplest and at the same time one of the most impressive sights i ever witnessed	4323
dev-other/4323/13259/4323-13259-0026.flac	there must have been a hundred of these women and i was told many of them had been converted at the meetings just recently	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0000.flac	there was no answer and after one or two ineffectual attempts phronsie turned fearfully away	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0001.flac	ill try and she laid a quick hand on the knob	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0002.flac	two red spots burned on her cheeks and her pale blue eyes snapped	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0003.flac	oh im sure i heard it raging up and down	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0004.flac	i dont want any dinner said charlotte drawing back	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0005.flac	yes indeed said polly cheerily just as fine as can be	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0006.flac	assuredly said old mister king with great satisfaction in pollys pleasure and at her success in drawing charlotte out	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0007.flac	and after this there were no more quiet days for charlotte chatterton	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0008.flac	oh bless me its you phronsie in pleased surprise	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0009.flac	yes grandpapa said phronsie coming in and shutting the door carefully i came on purpose to see you all alone	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0010.flac	so you did dear said mister king highly gratified and pushing away his writing table he held out his hand	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0011.flac	oh no grandpapa cried phronsie in a rapture i could never be too big for that so she perched up as of old on his knee then she folded her hands and looked gravely in his face	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0012.flac	well my dear what is it	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0013.flac	asked the old gentleman presently youve come to tell me something i suppose	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0014.flac	yes grandpapa i have said phronsie decidedly and it is most important too grandpapa and oh i do wish it so much and she clasped her hands tighter and sighed	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0015.flac	well then phronsie if you want it i suppose it must be said mister king quite as a matter of course	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0016.flac	oh she left you everything she had phronsie a couple of millions or so it is why	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0017.flac	charlotte poor repeated the old gentleman	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0018.flac	why no not exactly her father isnt rich but charlotte i think may do very well especially as i intend to keep her here for a while and then i shall never let her suffer phronsie never indeed	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0019.flac	grandpapa said phronsie wasnt missus chatterton aunt to charlotte	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0020.flac	if missus chatterton was aunt to charlotte persisted phronsie slowly it seems as if charlotte ought to have some of the money it really does grandpapa	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0021.flac	maybe said the old gentleman with a short laugh and i shouldnt wonder if cousin eunice was sorry over a few other things too phronsie	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0022.flac	wouldnt it make her very glad if i gave charlotte some of the money	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0023.flac	for answer mister king set her down hastily on the floor and took two or three turns up and down the room	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0024.flac	oh i do so wish i might she said theres so much for a little girl like me	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0025.flac	it would be so nice to have charlotte have some with me still no answer	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0026.flac	i was writing a note to missus fargo said phronsie putting up her lips for a kiss	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0027.flac	sure as i can be phronsie said old mister king smiling good by dear	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0028.flac	there there my sisters boy shall never say that but come in come in	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0029.flac	not to be ungracious the young man threw himself into a chair	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0030.flac	oh hang it uncle why cant you let me alone	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0031.flac	which is a wonder interpolated pickering	4323

dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0033.flac	for heavens sake pickering cried his uncle darting in front of the chair and its restless occupant dont say that again	4323
dev-other/4323/18416/4323-18416-0034.flac	ive been a lazy dog all my life and a good for naught but i hope ive not sunk to that	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0000.flac	the next moment he fell back in amazement before the impetuous rush of a starry eyed flushed cheeked young woman who demanded	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0001.flac	where is he pete miss billy gasped the old man	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0002.flac	aunt hannahs cheeks too were flushed and her eyes starry but with dismay and anger the last because she did not like the way pete had said miss billys name	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0003.flac	it was one matter for her to object to this thing billy was doing but quite another for pete to do it of course its she	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0004.flac	retorted aunt hannah testily as if you yourself didnt bring her here with your crazy messages at this time of night pete where is he	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0005.flac	interposed billy tell mister bertram i am here or wait ill go right in and surprise him	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0006.flac	pete had recovered himself by now but he did not even glance toward aunt hannah	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0007.flac	miss billy miss billy youre an angel straight from heaven you are you are oh im so glad you came	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0008.flac	itll be all right now all right hes in the den miss billy	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0009.flac	billy turned eagerly but before she could take so much as one step toward the door at the end of the hall aunt hannahs indignant voice arrested her billy stop	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0010.flac	pete go tell your master that we are here and ask if he will receive us petes lips twitched	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0011.flac	but his face was preternaturally grave when he spoke	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0012.flac	a flying figure brushed by him and fell on its knees by the couch with a low cry bertrams eyes flew open	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0013.flac	dong ling found him there a minute later polishing a silver teaspoon with a fringed napkin that had been spread over bertrams tray	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0014.flac	in the hall above aunt hannah was crying into williams gray linen duster that hung on the hall rack aunt hannahs handkerchief was on the floor back at hillside	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0015.flac	then very gradually it dawned over them that there was after all something strange and unexplained in it all	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0016.flac	as if to make sure that she was here like this he drew her even closer bertram was so thankful that he did have one arm that was usable	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0017.flac	why of of course stammered billy i couldnt help thinking that maybe you had found out you didnt want me	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0018.flac	demanded bertram angry and mystified	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0019.flac	as for my not painting again you didnt understand pete dearie	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0020.flac	she pulled herself half away from bertrams encircling arm	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0021.flac	billy drew a quivering sigh	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0022.flac	good heavens is kate in this too bertrams voice was savage now	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0023.flac	well she wrote a letter	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0024.flac	billy laughed gayly but she shifted her position and did not meet her lovers eyes	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0025.flac	and you never did think for a minute billy that you cared for him	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0026.flac	he had not been slow to mark that swift lowering of her eyelids	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0027.flac	billy was so glad bertram had turned the question on her love instead of arkwrights	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0028.flac	after a minute billy stirred and sighed happily	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0029.flac	you see i wasnt in love with mister arkwright	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0030.flac	and and you didnt care specially for for miss winthrop	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0031.flac	billy put a soft finger on his lips	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0032.flac	bertram kissed the finger and subsided humph he commented	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0033.flac	well what is that is that kate too demanded bertram grimly	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0034.flac	there was another silence then suddenly bertram stirred	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0035.flac	billy im going to marry you to morrow he announced decisively	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0036.flac	i dont know as i can trust you out of my sight till then youll read something or hear something or get a letter from kate after breakfast to morrow morning that will set you saving me again and i dont want to be saved that way	4323

dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0038.flac	five days indeed sir	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0039.flac	i wonder if you think i can get ready to be married in five days	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0040.flac	dont want you to get ready retorted bertram promptly i saw marie get ready and i had all i wanted of it	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0041.flac	if you really must have all those miles of tablecloths and napkins and doilies and lace rufflings well do it afterwards not before but	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0042.flac	besides i need you to take care of me cut in bertram craftily	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0043.flac	the tender glow on billys face told its own story and bertrams eager eyes were not slow to read it	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0044.flac	sweetheart see here dear he cried softly tightening his good left arm	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0045.flac	billy my dear	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0046.flac	it was aunt hannahs plaintive voice at the doorway a little later	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0047.flac	we must go home and william is here too and wants to see you	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0048.flac	you mean itll be before october	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0049.flac	aunt hannah glanced from one to the other uncertainly	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0050.flac	yes nodded billy demurely	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0051.flac	yes i know that is a good while cut in bertram airily	4323
dev-other/4323/55228/4323-55228-0052.flac	we wanted it to morrow but we had to wait on account of the new license law	4323
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0000.flac	yet so strong was the effect upon him of contemplating a large fortune that in despite of reason and desire he lived in eager expectation of the word which should make him rich	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0001.flac	a part of that impression was due to the engagement which he must now fulfil	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0002.flac	to shuffle out of this duty would make him too ignoble even in his own eyes	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0003.flac	because in his salad days he dallied with a girl who had indeed many charms step by step he had come to the necessity of sacrificing his prospects to that raw attachment	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0004.flac	unable to think of work he left the house and wandered gloomily about regents park	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0005.flac	he felt himself ill used by destiny and therefore by marian who was fates instrument	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0006.flac	he wrote to marian	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0007.flac	will you let me hear or come and see me	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0008.flac	i scarcely thought of biffen as likely to kill himself	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0009.flac	but why the deuce did he go all the way out there	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0010.flac	i hoped you would bring me some news	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0011.flac	poverty i can only suppose	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0012.flac	but i will see whelpdale i hadnt come across biffen for a long time	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0013.flac	was he still so very poor	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0014.flac	asked amy compassionately	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0015.flac	im afraid so his book failed utterly	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0016.flac	oh if i had imagined him still in such distress surely i might have done something to help him	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0017.flac	perchance his death was in part attributable to that hopeless love	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0018.flac	he sent me a copy of his novel she said and i saw him once or twice after that	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0019.flac	having this subject to converse upon put the two more quickly at ease than could otherwise have been the case	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0020.flac	amy might take a foremost place among brilliant women	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0021.flac	especially now that her father is threatened with blindness	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0022.flac	is it so serious	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0023.flac	even if mister yule recovers his sight it is not at all likely that he will be able to work as before	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0024.flac	our difficulties are so grave that	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0025.flac	he paused and let his hand fail despondently	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0026.flac	i have a good deal of will you remember and what i have set my mind upon no doubt i shall some day achieve	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0027.flac	there was silence	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0028.flac	the last three years he continued have made no slight difference in my position	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0029.flac	recall where i stood when you first knew me	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0030.flac	just now i am in need of a little encouragement	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0031.flac	you dont notice any falling off in my work recently	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0032.flac	do you see my things in the current and so on generally	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0033.flac	sometimes i believe i have detected you when there was no signature	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0034.flac	her story in that girls paper has attracted attention	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0035.flac	and i could so easily put her at rest by renouncing all claim upon her	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0036.flac	i surmise that that you yourself would also be put at rest by such a decision	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0037.flac	dont look at me with that ironical smile he pleaded	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0038.flac	i couldnt go about declaring that i was heartbroken in any event i must be content for people to judge me according to their disposition and judgments are pretty sure to be unfavourable what can i do	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0039.flac	the case is too delicate i fear for my advice	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0040.flac	well ill go back to my scribbling	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0041.flac	again jasper held the white soft hand for a superfluous moment	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0042.flac	yet for such feelings he reproached himself and the reproach made him angry	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0043.flac	marian could not mistake the air of restless trouble on her companions smooth countenance	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0044.flac	she had divined that there was some grave reason for this summons and the panting with which she had approached was half caused by the anxious beats of her heart	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0045.flac	he began abruptly	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0046.flac	he gave her such details as he had obtained then added	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0047.flac	there are two of my companions fallen in the battle	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0048.flac	i ought to think myself a lucky fellow marian what	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0049.flac	you are better fitted to fight your way jasper	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0050.flac	more of a brute you mean	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0051.flac	you know very well i dont	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0052.flac	i have made up my mind about our affairs he went on presently	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0053.flac	yes	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0054.flac	will you marry me and let us take our chance	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0055.flac	you feel yourself indispensable to your father at present	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0056.flac	i should be so afraid of the effect upon his health jasper	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0057.flac	she paused and looked up at him touchingly	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0058.flac	dear i cant feel it would be my duty to renounce you because my father had become blind	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0059.flac	has one thing occurred to you	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0060.flac	will he consent to receive an allowance from a person whose name is missus milvain	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0061.flac	and if he obstinately refuses what then what is before him	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0062.flac	she listened anxiously and reflected	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0063.flac	as i have said there is the very serious doubt whether your father would accept money from you when you are my wife	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0064.flac	it isnt your fault marian and well then theres only one thing to do	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0065.flac	except jasper that if father is helpless i must find means of assuring his support	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0066.flac	do you think them insurmountable	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0067.flac	that is just what i have decided is impossible marian you shall have the plain truth	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0068.flac	i dont trust myself	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0069.flac	but shall you face them willingly	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0070.flac	put up your umbrella marian	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0071.flac	what do i care for a drop of rain she exclaimed with passionate sadness when all my life is at stake how am i to understand you	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0072.flac	every word you speak seems intended to dishearten me	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0073.flac	why need you conceal it if that is the truth	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0074.flac	is that what you mean by saying you distrust yourself	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0075.flac	we must see each other again marian	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0076.flac	how am i to live an hour in such uncertainty as this	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0077.flac	i do wish it	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0078.flac	her emotion had an effect upon him and his voice trembled	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0079.flac	there is no natural law that a child should surrender everything for her parents	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0080.flac	you know so much more of the world than i do cant you advise me	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0081.flac	is there no way of providing for my father	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0082.flac	good god this is frightful marian i cant stand it	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0083.flac	i will be faithful to you	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0084.flac	he had made a pretence of holding his umbrella over her but marian turned away and walked to a little distance and stood beneath the shelter of a great tree her face averted from him	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0085.flac	moving to follow he saw that her frame was shaken by soundless sobbing	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0086.flac	in what can there be more selfishness	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0087.flac	but i couldnt say a word that would seem to invite such misery as this	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0088.flac	you dont love me jasper and thats an end of everything	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0089.flac	happiness or misery come to us by fate	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0090.flac	is it in my power to make you happy	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0091.flac	but if you had said you loved me before that i should have it always to remember	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0092.flac	if i believe anything i believe that i did love you	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0093.flac	what can you say to me more than you have said now	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0094.flac	remember me as a man who disregarded priceless love such as yours to go and make himself a proud position among fools and knaves indeed thats what it comes to	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0095.flac	soon enough you would thoroughly despise me and though i should know it was merited my perverse pride would revolt against it	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0096.flac	what can be simpler than the truth	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0097.flac	it is a thing that happens every day either in man or woman and all that honour demands is the courage to confess the truth	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0098.flac	marian will you do this will you let our engagement last for another six months but without our meeting during that time	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0099.flac	that seems to me childish	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0100.flac	the rain fell unceasingly and with it began to mingle an autumnal mist	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0101.flac	jasper delayed a moment then asked calmly	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0102.flac	are you going to the museum yes	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0103.flac	go home again for this morning marian you cant work	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0104.flac	i must and i have no time to lose	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0105.flac	good bye she gave him her hand	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0106.flac	they looked at each other for an instant then marian left the shelter of the tree opened her umbrella and walked quickly away	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0107.flac	jasper did not watch her he had the face of a man who is suffering a severe humiliation	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0108.flac	his sister said very little for she recognised genuine suffering in his tones and aspect	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0109.flac	a few weeks ago he actually proposed to a woman for whom he does not pretend to have the slightest affection but who is very rich and who seemed likely to be foolish enough to marry him	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0110.flac	yesterday morning he received her final answer a refusal	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0111.flac	you will understand though surely you need no fresh proof how utterly unworthy he is of you	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0112.flac	you are the only friend i have of my own sex and i could not bear to lose you	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0113.flac	several days passed before there came a reply	4515
dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0114.flac	i must only ask that you will write to me without the least reference to these troubles tell me always about yourself and be sure that you cannot tell me too much	4515
dev-other/4570/102353/4570-102353-0000.flac	we had then but little of that minute and accurate knowledge of the interior of the continent which was requisite for a determination of the problem	4570
dev-other/4570/102353/4570-102353-0001.flac	several different parties were therefore organized to examine the various routes supposed to be practicable within the northern and southern limits of the united states	4570
dev-other/4570/102353/4570-102353-0002.flac	the only discrimination made was in the more prompt and thorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern line and this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficult of execution of all the surveys	4570
dev-other/4570/102353/4570-102353-0003.flac	inquiries were made with regard to gunpowder which subsequently led to the use of a coarser grain for artillery	4570
dev-other/4570/102353/4570-102353-0004.flac	the officers of these regiments were chosen partly by selection from those already in service in the regular army and partly by appointment from civil life	4570
dev-other/4570/102353/4570-102353-0005.flac	under instructions from the president the list was therefore revised and modified in accordance with this new element of geographical distribution	4570
dev-other/4570/102353/4570-102353-0006.flac	after some further discussion of the question the visitors withdrew dissatisfied with the result of the interview	4570
dev-other/4570/102353/4570-102353-0007.flac	the quartermaster general on hearing of this conversation hastened to inform me that it was all a mistake that the appointee to the office had been confounded with his father who was a well known whig but that he the son was a democrat	4570
dev-other/4570/102353/4570-102353-0008.flac	i assured the general that this was altogether immaterial adding that it was a very pretty quarrel as it stood and that i had no desire to effect a settlement of it on any inferior issue	4570
dev-other/4570/14911/4570-14911-0000.flac	nevertheless in general appearance the harrier and the foxhound are very much alike the one obvious distinction being that of size	4570
dev-other/4570/14911/4570-14911-0001.flac	if you want to hunt your harriers on foot sixteen inches is quite big enough almost too big to run with but if you are riding to them twenty inches is a useful height or even nineteen inches	4570
dev-other/4570/14911/4570-14911-0002.flac	it is useless to lay down any hard and fast rule as to colour it is so much a matter of individual taste	4570
dev-other/4570/14911/4570-14911-0003.flac	but puppies are usually sent out to walk and may easily be procured to be kept and reared until they are old enough to be entered to their work	4570
dev-other/4570/14911/4570-14911-0004.flac	he is of course finer but with the length of neck so perfect in the bigger hound the little shoulders of the same pattern and the typical quarters and second thighs	4570
dev-other/4570/14911/4570-14911-0005.flac	and when he is fairly on a line of course he sticks to it as the saying is like a beagle	4570
dev-other/4570/14911/4570-14911-0006.flac	it is quite possible therefore that the beagle was crossed with the welsh southern or otterhound to get more size and power as there certainly was a welsh rough coated beagle of good eighteen inches and an almost identical contemporary that was called the essex beagle	4570

dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0007.flac	it even seemed to serafima aleksandrovna that she was in love with her future husband and this made her happy	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0008.flac	the bride was also good looking she was a tall dark eyed dark haired girl somewhat timid but very tactful	5543

dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0010.flac	this might at the proper opportunity prove useful	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0011.flac	after their marriage there was nothing in the manner of sergey modestovich to suggest anything wrong to his wife	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0012.flac	later however when his wife was about to have a child sergey modestovich established connexions elsewhere of a light and temporary nature	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0013.flac	serafima aleksandrovna found this out and to her own astonishment was not particularly hurt she awaited her infant with a restless anticipation that swallowed every other feeling	5543

dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0024.flac	her mother was growing more absorbed every moment by her interest in the game her heart beat with short quick strokes and she pressed even closer to the wall disarranging her hair still more	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0025.flac	lelechka suddenly glanced toward her mothers corner and screamed with joy	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0026.flac	through the half closed doors he heard the laughter the joyous outcries the sound of romping	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0027.flac	even fedosya felt abashed now for her mistress now for herself	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0028.flac	he liked coming here where everything was beautifully arranged this was done by serafima aleksandrovna who wished to surround her little girl from her very infancy only with the loveliest things	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0029.flac	serafima aleksandrovna dressed herself tastefully this too she did for lelechka with the same end in view	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0030.flac	one thing sergey modestovich had not become reconciled to and this was his wifes almost continuous presence in the nursery	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0031.flac	its just as i thought i knew that id find you here he said with a derisive and condescending smile	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0032.flac	merely you see that the child should feel its own individuality he explained in answer to serafima aleksandrovnas puzzled glance	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0033.flac	shes still so little said serafima aleksandrovna	5543

dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0035.flac	ill think it over his wife answered smiling as he did coldly but genially	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0036.flac	then they began to talk of something else	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0037.flac	that the mistress does it well thats one thing but that the young lady does it thats bad	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0038.flac	why asked fedosya with curiosity	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0039.flac	this expression of curiosity gave her face the look of a wooden roughly painted doll	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0040.flac	yes thats bad repeated agathya with conviction terribly bad well	5543

dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0042.flac	its the surest sign	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0043.flac	the old woman had invented this sign quite suddenly herself and she was evidently very proud of it	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0044.flac	madam madam she said quietly in a trembling voice	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0045.flac	serafima aleksandrovna gave a start	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0046.flac	fedosyas face made her anxious	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0047.flac	what is it fedosya she asked with great concern is there anything wrong with lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0048.flac	no madam said fedosya as she gesticulated with her hands to reassure her mistress and to make her sit down	5543

dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0053.flac	you see madam its a kind of omen explained fedosya abruptly in a shamefaced way	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0054.flac	nonsense said serafima aleksandrovna	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0055.flac	who told you all this asked serafima aleksandrovna in an austere low voice	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0056.flac	knows exclaimed serafima aleksandrovna in irritation as though she wished to protect herself somehow from this sudden anxiety	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0057.flac	what nonsense as though lelechka could die	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0058.flac	she saw clearly that there could be no possible connexion between a childs quite ordinary diversion and the continuation of the childs life	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0059.flac	she made a special effort that evening to occupy her mind with other matters but her thoughts returned involuntarily to the fact that lelechka loved to hide herself	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0060.flac	when lelechka was still quite small and had learned to distinguish between her mother and her nurse she sometimes sitting in her nurses arms made a sudden roguish grimace and hid her laughing face in the nurses shoulder	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0061.flac	then she would look out with a sly glance	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0062.flac	though she reproached herself at once for this unfounded superstitious dread nevertheless she could not enter wholeheartedly into the spirit of lelechkas favourite game and she tried to divert lelechkas attention to something else	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0063.flac	she eagerly complied with her mothers new wishes	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0064.flac	serafima aleksandrovna tried desperately to amuse lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0065.flac	perhaps thought serafima aleksandrovna she is not as strongly drawn to the world as other children who are attracted by many things	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0066.flac	if this is so is it not a sign of organic weakness	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0067.flac	serafima aleksandrovna herself began the game once or twice though she played it with a heavy heart	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0068.flac	she suffered as though committing an evil deed with full consciousness	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0069.flac	it was a sad day for serafima aleksandrovna	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0070.flac	her mother covered her with a blue blanket	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0071.flac	lelechka drew her sweet little hands from under the blanket and stretched them out to embrace her mother her mother bent down	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0072.flac	she seemed so small and so frail under the blanket that covered her	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0073.flac	serafima aleksandrovna remained standing over lelechkas bed a long while and she kept looking at lelechka with tenderness and fear	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0074.flac	im a mother is it possible that i shouldnt be able to protect her she thought as she imagined the various ills that might befall lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0075.flac	she prayed long that night but the prayer did not relieve her sadness	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0076.flac	several days passed lelechka caught cold	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0077.flac	the fever came upon her at night	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0078.flac	when serafima aleksandrovna awakened by fedosya came to lelechka and saw her looking so hot so restless and so tormented she instantly recalled the evil omen and a hopeless despair took possession of her from the first moments	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0079.flac	a doctor was called and everything was done that is usual on such occasions but the inevitable happened	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0080.flac	and lelechka grew feebler from hour to hour	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0081.flac	nothing made her so unhappy as the reiterations of fedosya uttered between sobs she hid herself and hid herself our lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0082.flac	fever was consuming lelechka and there were times when she lost consciousness and spoke in delirium	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0083.flac	three days passed torturing like a nightmare	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0084.flac	serafima aleksandrovna hid her face behind the curtains near lelechkas bed how tragic	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0085.flac	a white mamochka whispered lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0086.flac	mamochkas white face became blurred and everything grew dark before lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0087.flac	she met her husband	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0088.flac	serafima aicksandrovna was standing by the coffin and looking dully at her dead child	5543

dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0091.flac	shell be up in a minute persisted serafima aleksandrovna her eyes fixed on the dead little girl	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0092.flac	sergey modestovich looked round him cautiously he was afraid of the unseemly and of the ridiculous	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0093.flac	sima dont agitate yourself he repeated	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0094.flac	he was confused and annoyed	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0095.flac	her face seemed tranquil and her eyes were dry	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0096.flac	she went into the nursery and began to walk round the room looking into those places where lelechka used to hide herself	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0097.flac	she walked all about the room and bent now and then to look under the table or under the bed and kept on repeating cheerfully where is my little one where is my lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0098.flac	after she had walked round the room once she began to make her quest anew	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0099.flac	fedosya motionless with dejected face sat in a corner and looked frightened at her mistress then she suddenly burst out sobbing and she wailed loudly	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0100.flac	she hid herself and hid herself our lelechka our angelic little soul	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0101.flac	when she entered the parlour there were several people between her and lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0102.flac	there was an oppressive feeling of heaviness in serafima aleksandrovnas head as she approached lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0103.flac	lelechka lay there still and pale and smiled pathetically	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0104.flac	the little one did not reply	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0105.flac	serafima aleksandrovna stood up erect sighed in a lost way smiled and called loudly lelechka	5543
dev-other/5543/27761/5543-27761-0106.flac	lelechka was being carried out	5543
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0000.flac	captain bull the commander of a small garrison at saybrook permitted him to land but when the governor began to read his commission bull ordered him to be silent	5849

dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0002.flac	captain wadsworth became a little uneasy though he was still inclined to treat the matter lightly	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0003.flac	we have stubbornly refused to yield our charter voluntarily for it is the guardian of our political rights	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0004.flac	that is true captain wadsworth continued mister prince and to subdue our stubbornness this viceroy has come to hartford with sixty armed men to demand the surrender of the charter in person	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0005.flac	captain wadsworth bounded to his feet in a rage and placing his hand on the hilt of his sword declared he shall not have it	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0006.flac	the day was well nigh spent when he arrived and the members were engaged in a heated debate on a subject of the utmost importance	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0007.flac	he consented however to await the discussion but as soon as it was ended he declared that he would have the charter	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0008.flac	after the captain had taken two or three turns across the room he paused and asked	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0009.flac	what is the assembly doing engaged in a debate	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0010.flac	and will he wait until it has ended he has promised to do so	5849

dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0013.flac	as soon as he was gone charles stevens said	5849

dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0017.flac	remember the work must be done right at the time not too soon nor too late	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0018.flac	the sun was setting and the captain said	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0019.flac	come charles let us hasten to the assembly	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0020.flac	by no means but i want you to be fully impressed with the seriousness of your mission	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0021.flac	take your place charles and be prepared to do your part whispered captain wadsworth	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0022.flac	charles got as close to the long table used by the secretaries as possible without attracting special attention	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0023.flac	the discussion went on darkness came and four lighted candles were placed on the table and two set on a shelf on the wall	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0024.flac	those two candles on the wall were a great annoyance to charles until he saw a man stationed near them	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0025.flac	though the lights were extinguished through the windows the faint starlight dimly illuminated the scene	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0026.flac	he followed him as rapidly as he could	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0027.flac	the youth was close behind him and when they were outside seized his arm	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0028.flac	boy have a care how you approach me	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0029.flac	the soldiers began to crowd about the house when at a signal from captain wadsworth the train bands came on the scene and prepared to grapple with the soldiers	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0030.flac	where is the charter	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0031.flac	you have your soldiers at the door and we have the train bands of connecticut ready to defend us against violence	5849

dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0036.flac	little did the captain or his youthful assistant dream that their simple act would make the old tree historic	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0037.flac	the tree in which the document was hidden was ever afterward known as the charter oak	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0038.flac	it remained vigorous bearing fruit every year until a little after midnight august eighteen fifty six when it was prostrated by a heavy storm of wind	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0039.flac	when the order for the seizure of the charters was first made known the assembly of rhode island sent a most loyal address to the king saying	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0040.flac	he formally dissolved the assembly broke the seal of the colony which bore the figure of an anchor and the word hope admitted five of the inhabitants into his legislative council and assumed the functions of governor but he did not take away the parchment on which the charter was written	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0041.flac	from that time until the enforced union of the colonies for mutual defence at the breaking out of the french and indian war the inhabitants of rhode island bore their share in the defensive efforts especially when the hostile savages hung along the frontiers of new york like an ill omened cloud	5849
dev-other/5849/50873/5849-50873-0042.flac	the history of that commonwealth is identified with that of all new england from the beginning of king williams war soon after to the expulsion of andros	5849

dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0002.flac	to this cord was fastened a heavy rope or cable	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0003.flac	whats that board for asked bert as he saw a board following the cable	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0004.flac	thats the directions said hal	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0005.flac	they are printed in a number of languages and they tell the crew to carry the end of the cable high up the mast and fasten it strongly there	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0006.flac	oh i see said bert the line will stretch then and the breeches buoy will go out on a pulley	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0007.flac	it was clear day now and much of the wicked storm had passed	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0008.flac	with the daylight came girls and women to the beach	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0009.flac	missus bobbsey missus minturn nellie and her mother besides dorothy and nan were all there flossie and freddie being obliged to stay home with dinah and susan	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0010.flac	of course the girls asked all sorts of questions and bert and hal tried to answer them as best they could	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0011.flac	it seemed a long time before any movement of the cable showed that the buoy was returning	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0012.flac	nearer and nearer it came until now a mans head could be seen	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0013.flac	the girls and women were too frightened to talk and nellie clung close to her mother	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0014.flac	a big roller dashing in finished the work for the life guards and a man in the cork belt bounded upon shore	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0015.flac	everybody gathered around and nellie with a strange face and a stranger hope broke through the crowd to see the rescued man	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0016.flac	oh it is my father she screamed falling right into the arms of the drenched man	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0017.flac	but the half drowned man rubbed his eyes as if he could not believe them then the next minute he pressed his little daughter to his heart unable to speak a word	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0018.flac	and is george bingham out there anxiously asked the brother	5849

dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0021.flac	here comes another man exclaimed the people as this time a big man dashed on the sands	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0022.flac	well i declare we did land on a friendly shore	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0023.flac	just as mister bingham said the life saving work turned out to be a social affair for there was a great time greeting nellies father and hals uncle	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0024.flac	and hal and his father too put in nan	5849
dev-other/5849/50962/5849-50962-0025.flac	what a morning that was at sunset beach	5849

dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0001.flac	and everybody was so happy	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0002.flac	the neptune the vessel that had struck on the sand bar was now safely anchored near shore and the sailors came in and out in row boats back and forth to land just as they wished	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0003.flac	then we had to go back to work at the logs went on the captain and then one of our crew took a fever	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0004.flac	that was what delayed us so	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0005.flac	finally we had every log loaded on the schooner and we started off	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0006.flac	we counted on getting home last week when this last storm struck us and drove us out of our course	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0007.flac	about the value asked mister bobbsey who was down from the city	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0008.flac	the value repeated the captain aside so that the strangers might not hear	5849

dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0011.flac	maybe aunt emily will take you down to the city on her shopping tour suggested nan	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0012.flac	he made the clerks remove all the truck from the aisles and i guess everybody was glad the army fell down	5849
dev-other/5849/50963/5849-50963-0013.flac	the wonderful fresh air that these men lived in night and day had brightened their eyes too so that even the plainest face and the most awkward man among them was as nimble as an athlete from his perfect exercise	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0000.flac	i dont know how to say good by to you nellie told dorothy and nan next morning	5849

dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0003.flac	and dorothy went up and down the room like the pictures of cinderellas proud sisters	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0004.flac	and we will be on hand thank you replied the joking dorothy	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0005.flac	come nellie called missus mc laughlin i am ready where is your hat	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0006.flac	we might be able to manage that too nellie told him	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0007.flac	my uncle is a fireman and he can take us through his engine house	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0008.flac	most of them i guess answered bert	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0009.flac	well we have had a good vacation and i am willing to go to work again	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0010.flac	so am i declared nan vacation was just long enough i think	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0011.flac	mister bobbsey was down from the city of course to take the family home and now all hands even freddie and flossie were busy packing up	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0012.flac	there were the shells to be looked after the fish nets besides downy the duck and snoop the cat	5849
dev-other/5849/50964/5849-50964-0013.flac	and so our little friends had spent all their vacation	5849
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0000.flac	his characters get drunk or go mad with jealousy or fall in epileptic fits or rave hysterically	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0001.flac	if dostoevsky had had less vision he would have been strindberg	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0002.flac	like them he is a novelist of torture	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0003.flac	certainly the lust of cruelty the lust of destruction for destructions sake is the most conspicuous of the deadly sins in dostoevskys men and women	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0004.flac	he may not be a cruel author	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0005.flac	but they are never in balance they are always in demoniacal conflict	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0006.flac	even the lust is never or hardly ever the lust of a more or less sane man	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0007.flac	dostoevsky could not have described the sin of nekhludov in resurrection	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0008.flac	this is a madhouse cries some one in the idiot	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0009.flac	one result of this is a multiplicity of action	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0010.flac	even the talk is of actions more than of ideas	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0011.flac	he sows violent deeds not with the hand but with the sack	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0012.flac	but one had noticed during those last two days that the other was wearing a silver watch on a yellow bead chain which he seems not to have seen on him before	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0013.flac	he took a knife and when his friend had turned away he approached him cautiously from behind took aim turned his eyes heavenwards crossed himself and praying fervently god forgive me for christs sake	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0014.flac	he never paints everyman he always projects dostoevsky or a nightmare of dostoevsky	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0015.flac	that is why crime and punishment belongs to a lower range of fiction than anna karenina or fathers and sons	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0016.flac	we sympathize indeed with the fears the bravado the despair that succeed the crime	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0017.flac	he is a grotesque made alive by sheer imaginative intensity and passion	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0018.flac	one does not grudge an artist an abnormal character or two	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0019.flac	he invents vicious grotesques as dickens invents comic grotesques	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0020.flac	was very fond of hanging cats and burying them with great ceremony	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0021.flac	as for the karamazovs themselves he portrays the old father and the eldest of his sons hating each other and fighting like brutal maniacs	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0022.flac	serve him right shouted dmitri breathlessly	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0023.flac	if i havent killed him ill come again and kill him	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0024.flac	it is easy to see why dostoevsky has become a popular author	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0025.flac	no melodramatist ever poured out incident upon the stage from such a horn of plenty	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0026.flac	dostoevsky is always ready to show them all in at once	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0027.flac	on two opposite pages of the idiot one finds the following characters brought in by name general epanchin prince s adelaida ivanovna lizaveta prokofyevna yevgeny pavlovitch radomsky princess byelokonsky aglaia prince myshkin kolya ivolgin ippolit varya ferdyshchenko nastasya filippovna nina alexandrovna ganya ptitsyn and general ivolgin	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0028.flac	but the secret of dostoevskys appeal is something more than the multitude and thrill of his incidents and characters	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0029.flac	mister murry boldly faces the difficulty and attempts the definition	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0030.flac	to him dostoevskys work is the record of a great mind seeking for a way of life it is more than a record of struggle it is the struggle itself	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0031.flac	and those voices take shape in certain unforgettable fragments of dialogue that have been spoken by one spirit to another in some ugly mean tavern set in surrounding darkness	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0032.flac	ultimately they are the creations not of a man who desired to be but of a spirit which sought to know	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0033.flac	because they are possessed they are no longer men and women	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0034.flac	this is all in a measure true	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0035.flac	to say this is not to deny the spiritual content of dostoevskys work the anguish of the imprisoned soul as it battles with doubt and denial and despair	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0036.flac	there is in dostoevsky a suggestion of caliban trying to discover some better god than setebos	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0037.flac	the ultimate attitude of dostoevsky is as christian as the apostle peters lord i believe help thou mine unbelief	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0038.flac	and beyond the dark night of suffering and dissipating the night dostoevsky still sees the light of christian compassion	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0039.flac	or even by the compassion of others like prince myshkin in the idiot	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0040.flac	his work like his face bears the mark of this terrible conflict	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0041.flac	the novels are the perfect image of the man	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0042.flac	as to the man himself the vicomte de voguee described him as he saw him in the last years of his life	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0043.flac	when he became excited on a certain point one could have sworn that one had seen him before seated on a bench in a police court awaiting trial or among vagabonds who passed their time begging before the prison doors	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0044.flac	at all other times he carried that look of sad and gentle meekness seen on the images of old slavonic saints	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0045.flac	that is the portrait of the man one sees behind dostoevskys novels a portrait one might almost have inferred from the novels	6123
dev-other/6123/59150/6123-59150-0046.flac	it is a figure that at once fascinates and repels	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0000.flac	he is not by temperament a singer	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0001.flac	his music is a still small voice unevenly matched against his consciousness of midnight and storm	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0002.flac	truth to tell mister hardy is neither sufficiently articulate nor sufficiently fastidious to be a great poet	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0003.flac	he does not express life easily in beautiful words or in images	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0004.flac	thus he writes in i found her out there of one who	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0005.flac	there could not be an uglier and more prosaic exaggeration than is contained in the image in the last line	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0006.flac	and prose intrudes in the choice of words as well as in images	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0007.flac	take for example the use of the word domiciled in the passage in the same poem about	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0008.flac	when we as strangers sought their catering care veiled smiles bespoke their thought of what we were	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0009.flac	catering care is an appalling phrase	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0010.flac	is a line of good poetry	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0011.flac	you did not come and marching time drew on and wore me numb yet less for loss of your dear presence there than that i thus found lacking in your make that high compassion which can overbear reluctance for pure loving kindness sake grieved i when as the hope hour stroked its sum you did not come	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0012.flac	there are hints of the grand style of lyric poetry in these lines but phrases like in your make and as the hope hour stroked its sum are discords that bring it tumbling to the levels of victorian commonplace	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0013.flac	he has a temperament sensitive beyond that of all but a few recent writers to the pain and passion of human beings	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0014.flac	one can remember poem after poem of his with a theme that might easily have served for mister hardy too late cristina the lost mistress the last ride together the statue and the bust to name a few	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0015.flac	but what a sense of triumph there is in brownings tragedies	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0016.flac	his world is a place of opulence not of poverty	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0017.flac	to have loved even for an hour is with browning to live for ever after in the inheritance of a mighty achievement	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0018.flac	to have loved for an hour is in mister hardys imagination to have deepened the sadness even more than the beauty of ones memories	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0019.flac	for then i undistrest by hearts grown cold to me could lonely wait my endless rest with equanimity	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0020.flac	but time to make me grieve part steals lets part abide and shakes this fragile frame at eve with throbbings of noontide	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0021.flac	and despair is by no means triumphant in what is perhaps the most attractive of all mister hardys poems the oxen	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0022.flac	we pictured the meek mild creatures where they dwelt in their strawy pen nor did it occur to one of us there to doubt they were kneeling then	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0023.flac	the mood of faith however or rather of delight in the memory of faith is not mister hardys prevailing mood	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0024.flac	he can enter upon a war without ironical doubts as we see in the song men who march away	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0025.flac	how long he cries in a poem written some years ago	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0026.flac	when shall the saner softer polities whereof we dream have sway in each proud land and patriotism grown godlike scorn to stand bondslave to realms but circle earth and seas	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0027.flac	but perhaps his characteristic attitude to war is to be found not in lines like these but in that melancholy poem the souls of the slain in which the souls of the dead soldiers return to their country and question a senior soul flame as to how their friends and relatives have kept their doughty deeds in remembrance	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0028.flac	and general how hold out our sweethearts sworn loyal as doves	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0029.flac	some fickle and fleet hearts have found them new loves	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0030.flac	and our wives quoth another resignedly dwell they on our deeds	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0031.flac	mister hardy has too bitter a sense of reality to believe much in the glory of war	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0032.flac	the real world to mister hardy is the world of ancient human things in which war has come to be a hideous irrelevance	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0033.flac	it may be thought on the other hand that mister hardys poems about war are no more expressive of tragic futility than his poems about love	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0034.flac	futility and frustration are ever recurring themes in both	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0035.flac	his lovers like his soldiers rot in the grave defeated of their glory	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0036.flac	lovers are always severed both in life and in death	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0037.flac	in beyond the last lamp we have the same mournful cry over severance	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0038.flac	no shade of pinnacle or tree or tower while earth endures will fall on my mound and within the hour steal on to yours one robin never haunt our two green covertures	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0039.flac	they bring us face to face with an experience intenser than our own	6123
dev-other/6123/59186/6123-59186-0040.flac	nothing of tiniest worth have i wrought pondered planned no one thing asking blame or praise since the pale corpse like birth of this diurnal unit bearing blanks in all its rays dullest of dull hued days	6123
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0000.flac	its a sad thing for a body to lack brains when she wants to be a teacher isnt it	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0001.flac	penelope has studied so hard all winter and she hasnt gone anywhere thought the older sister wistfully	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0002.flac	doris dreamed of pretty dresses all that night and thought about them all the next day	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0003.flac	so it must be confessed did penelope though she would not have admitted it for the world	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0004.flac	she knew that penelope had started out to say a new dress	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0005.flac	doris hunter i believe its an old quilt	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0006.flac	listen penelope my dear doris	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0007.flac	love to penelope and yourself	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0008.flac	your affectionate aunt adella hunter	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0009.flac	i dont see its beauty said penelope with a grimace	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0010.flac	it may have been pretty once but it is all faded now	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0011.flac	tell me dorrie does it argue a lack of proper respect for my ancestors that i cant feel very enthusiastic over this heirloom especially when grandmother hunter died years before i was born	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0012.flac	it was very kind of aunt adella to send it said doris dutifully	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0013.flac	why the wrong side is ever so much prettier than the right exclaimed penelope	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0014.flac	what lovely old timey stuff and not a bit faded	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0015.flac	i declare it is as good as new	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0016.flac	well let us go and have tea said penelope im decidedly hungry	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0017.flac	besides i see the poverty pucker coming	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0018.flac	it is something to possess an heirloom after all	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0019.flac	penelope was surprised as much as the tender sisterly heart could wish when doris flashed out upon her triumphantly on the evening of the party with the black skirt nicely pressed and re hung and the prettiest waist imaginable a waist that was a positive creation of dainty rose besprinkled silk with a girdle and knots of black velvet	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0020.flac	so penelope went to blanches party and her dress was the admiration of every girl there	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0021.flac	penelope thought her altogether charming	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0022.flac	she looks as if she had just stepped out of the frame of some lovely old picture she said to herself	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0023.flac	my aunt adella gave me gave us the material she stammered	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0024.flac	i am named after her missus fairweather suddenly put her arm about penelope and drew the young girl to her her lovely old face aglow with delight and tenderness	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0025.flac	then you are my grandniece she said	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0026.flac	when i saw your dress i felt sure you were related to her i should recognize that rosebud silk if i came across it in thibet	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0027.flac	penelope was four years older than i was but we were devoted to each other	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0028.flac	soon after this our mother died and our household was broken up	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0029.flac	my dear i am a very lonely old woman with nobody belonging to me	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0030.flac	now she patted missus fairweathers soft old hand affectionately	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0031.flac	doris and penelope found their lives and plans changed in the twinkling of an eye	6267
dev-other/6267/53049/6267-53049-0032.flac	when missus fairweather had gone doris and penelope looked at each other	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0000.flac	as she slipped into her blue print afternoon dress her aunt called to her from below	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0001.flac	aunt jane was standing at the foot of the stairs with a lamp in one hand and a year old baby clinging to the other	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0002.flac	she was a big shapeless woman with a round good natured face cheerful and vulgar as a sunflower was aunt jane at all times and occasions	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0003.flac	i want to run over and see how missus brixby is this evening siddy and you must take care of the baby till i get back	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0004.flac	sidney sighed and went downstairs for the baby	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0005.flac	all her days were alike as far as hard work and dullness went but she accepted them cheerfully and uncomplainingly	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0006.flac	but she did resent having to look after the baby when she wanted to write her letter	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0007.flac	the room was small a mere box above the kitchen which sidney shared with two small cousins	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0008.flac	her bed and the cot where the little girls slept filled up almost all the available space	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0009.flac	just at that particular angle one eye appeared to be as large as an orange while the other was the size of a pea and the mouth zigzagged from ear to ear	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0010.flac	sidney hated that mirror as virulently as she could hate anything	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0011.flac	her mother had died the day after and sidney thereupon had come into the hands of good aunt jane with those books for her dowry since nothing else was left after the expenses of the double funeral had been paid	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0012.flac	presently she began to write with a flush of real excitement on her face	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0013.flac	only one answer came to ellen douglas and that was forwarded to her by the long suffering editor of the maple leaf	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0014.flac	he wrote that although his age debarred him from membership in the club he was twenty and the limit was eighteen he read the letters of the department with much interest and often had thought of answering some of the requests for correspondents	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0015.flac	he never had done so but ellen douglass letter was so interesting that he had decided to write to her	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0016.flac	would she be kind enough to correspond with him	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0017.flac	he was two years out from the east and had not yet forgotten to be homesick at times	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0018.flac	sidney liked the letter and answered it	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0019.flac	she never expected to meet john lincoln nor did she wish to do so	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0020.flac	in the correspondence itself she found her pleasure	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0021.flac	john lincoln wrote breezy accounts of ranch life and adventures on the far western plains so alien and remote from snug humdrum plainfield life that sidney always had the sensation of crossing a gulf when she opened a letter from the bar n as for sidneys own letter this is the way it read as she wrote it	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0022.flac	the evergreens plainfield dear mister lincoln	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0023.flac	i love life and its bloom and brilliancy i love meeting new people i love the ripple of music the hum of laughter and conversation	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0024.flac	the man i had been talking with was paul moore the great novelist	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0025.flac	as it was i had contradicted him twice and he had laughed and liked it but his books will always have a new meaning to me henceforth through the insight he himself has given me	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0026.flac	it is such meetings as these that give life its sparkle for me	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0027.flac	you will be weary of my rhapsodies over her	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0028.flac	she has sympathy and understanding for my every mood	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0029.flac	yours sincerely sidney richmond	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0030.flac	aunt jane came home presently and carried away her sleeping baby sidney said her prayers went to bed and slept soundly and serenely she mailed her letter the next day and a month later an answer came	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0031.flac	sidney did not sleep that night but tossed restlessly about or cried in her pillow	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0032.flac	the good woman shook her head	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0033.flac	sidney trod the way of the transgressor and found that its thorns pierced to bone and marrow	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0034.flac	you see that road out thar	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0035.flac	and there was no harbour or glimpse of distant sea visible	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0036.flac	had the hotel keeper made a mistake	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0037.flac	this is his place nobody calls it the evergreens but myself	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0038.flac	i dont understand he said perplexedly	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0039.flac	oh sidney threw out her hands in a burst of passionate protest	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0040.flac	no and you never will understand i cant make you understand	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0041.flac	everything i told you about it and my life was just imagination	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0042.flac	then why did you write them he asked blankly	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0043.flac	why did you deceive me	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0044.flac	oh i didnt mean to deceive you i never thought of such a thing	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0045.flac	i just couldnt write you about my life here not because it was hard but it was so ugly and empty	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0046.flac	and when once i had begun i had to keep it up	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0047.flac	i found it so fascinating too	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0048.flac	those letters made that other life seem real to me i never expected to meet you	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0049.flac	these last four days since your letter came have been dreadful to me	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0050.flac	oh please go away and forgive me if you can	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0051.flac	it was worse than she had even thought it would be	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0052.flac	he was so handsome so manly so earnest eyed	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0053.flac	john lincoln opened the gate and went up to her	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0054.flac	please dont distress yourself so sidney he said unconsciously using her christian name	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0055.flac	i think i do understand	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0056.flac	im not such a dull fellow as you take me for	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0057.flac	after all those letters were true or rather there was truth in them	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0058.flac	this young man was certainly good at understanding	6267
dev-other/6267/65525/6267-65525-0059.flac	you youll forgive me then she stammered	6267
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0000.flac	hallo colonel how dye sell your wood this time	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0001.flac	why capting we must charge you three and a quarter this time the d l	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0002.flac	supper was over and i retired to my upper berth situated alongside and overlooking the brag table where the captain was deeply engaged having now the other pilot as his principal opponent	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0003.flac	head her in shore then and take in six cords if its good see to it thompson i cant very well leave the game now its getting right warm	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0004.flac	this pilots beating us all to smash the wooding completed we paddled on again	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0005.flac	they were anxious to learn the game and they did learn it	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0006.flac	still with all these disadvantages they continued playing they wanted to learn the game	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0007.flac	oh pretty glibly sir replied the mate we can scarcely tell what headway we are making for we are obliged to keep the middle of the river and there is the shadow of a fog rising	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0008.flac	this wood seems rather better than that we took in at yellow faces but were nearly out again and must be looking out for more	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0009.flac	i saw a light just ahead on the right shall we hail	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0010.flac	yes yes replied the captain ring the bell and ask em whats the price of wood up here	6455

dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0013.flac	the other pilots voice was again heard on deck how much have you	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0014.flac	only about ten cords sir was the reply of the youthful salesman	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0015.flac	the captain here told thompson to take six cords which would last till daylight and again turned his attention to the game	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0016.flac	the pilots here changed places when did they sleep	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0017.flac	wood taken in the caravan again took her place in the middle of the stream paddling on as usual day at length dawned	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0018.flac	i had risen and went out with the captain to enjoy a view of the bluffs	6455
dev-other/6455/66379/6455-66379-0019.flac	there it is exclaimed the captain stop her	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0000.flac	chapter twenty three may i go	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0001.flac	the very day after this octavia opened the fourth trunk	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0002.flac	evidently something had happened octavia she said mister dugald binnie is at oldclough who is he	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0003.flac	he is my grand uncle explained lucia tremulously he has a great deal of money	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0004.flac	i do not quite understand grandmamma octavia she said	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0005.flac	last night she came to my room to talk to me and this morning she came again and oh	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0006.flac	she broke out indignantly how could she speak to me in such a manner	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0007.flac	what did you understand	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0008.flac	i am to run after a man who does not care for me and make myself attractive in the hope that he will condescend to marry me because mister binnie may leave me his money	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0009.flac	do you wonder that it took even lady theobald a long time to say that	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0010.flac	well remarked octavia you wont do it i suppose i wouldnt worry	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0011.flac	oh i always knew it i didnt guess	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0012.flac	and she smiled ever so faintly	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0013.flac	that is one of the reasons why she loathes me so she added	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0014.flac	lucia thought deeply for a moment she recognized all at once several things she had been mystified by before	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0015.flac	octavia smiled a little again	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0016.flac	lucia sat thinking her hands clasped tightly	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0017.flac	i am glad i came here she said at length	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0018.flac	i think i shall never be afraid of her any more	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0019.flac	her delicate nostrils were dilated she held her head up her breath came fast there was a hint of exultation in her tone	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0020.flac	she walked very fast after she left the house	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0021.flac	but it was not against him that lucias indignation was aroused	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0022.flac	she wondered if he had heard her last words she fancied he had	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0023.flac	he took hold of her shaking little hand and looked down at her excited face	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0024.flac	i am angry she said you have never seen me angry before	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0025.flac	i am on my way to my to lady theobald	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0026.flac	he held her hand as calmly as before	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0027.flac	what are you going to say to her he asked she laughed again	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0028.flac	he held her hand rather closer	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0029.flac	she has made you very angry he said	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0030.flac	and then almost before she knew what she was doing she was pouring forth the whole of her story even more of it than she had told octavia	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0031.flac	lucia he said i wish you would let me go and talk with lady theobald you she said with a little start	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0032.flac	yes he answered let me go to her	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0033.flac	if you will say yes to that i think i can promise that you need never be afraid of her any more	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0034.flac	the fierce color died out of her cheeks and the tears rushed to her eyes	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0035.flac	she raised her face with a pathetic look	6455
dev-other/6455/67803/6455-67803-0036.flac	i am desperately in love with you he answered in his quietest way	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0000.flac	i accompany my granddaughter to this this entertainment her ladyship responded	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0001.flac	it is scarcely a joyous occasion to my mind	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0002.flac	no need to dress yourself like that if it isnt ejaculated mister binnie	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0003.flac	if i were sure this was the same man id go myself	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0004.flac	when i find a fellow whos neither knave nor fool i stick to him believe ill send to find out	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0005.flac	the only time he had made any comment upon her was the first time he saw her in the dress she had copied from octavias nice gown that he blurted out didnt get it here ill wager	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0006.flac	doesnt look like it he said gruffly	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0007.flac	no she answered i am not afraid at all	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0008.flac	i shall not be afraid again	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0009.flac	in fact she had perfectly confounded her ladyship by her demeanor	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0010.flac	i beg you will not speak to me of that again she said i will not listen	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0011.flac	and turning about she walked out of the room	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0012.flac	and nothing more had been said on the subject since	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0013.flac	before breakfast miss belinda was startled by the arrival of another telegram which ran as follows	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0014.flac	arrived to day per russia be with you tomorrow evening	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0015.flac	friend with me martin bassett	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0016.flac	well remarked octavia i suppose that would have been an advantage	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0017.flac	octavia was a marked figure upon the grounds at that garden party another dress my dear remarked missus burnham	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0018.flac	and what a charming color she has i declare she is usually paler	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0019.flac	perhaps we owe this to lord lansdowne	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0020.flac	shes prettier than ever to day and is enjoying herself	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0021.flac	she was enjoying herself mister francis barold observed it rather gloomily as he stood apart	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0022.flac	and then had come lord lansdowne who in crossing the lawn to shake hands with his host had been observed to keep his eye fixed upon one particular point burmistone he said after having spoken his first words who is that tall girl in white	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0023.flac	and in ten minutes lady theobald missus burnham mister barold and divers others too numerous to mention saw him standing at octavias side evidently with no intention of leaving it	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0024.flac	not long after this francis barold found his way to miss belinda who was very busy and rather nervous your niece is evidently enjoying herself he remarked	6455
dev-other/6455/67804/6455-67804-0025.flac	octavia is most happy to day answered miss belinda	6455

dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0001.flac	i remember the moon sailing a good gait among apparently stationary cloudlets i recall a deep black shadow lying before distant silvery mountains i glanced over the stark motionless canvases each of which concealed a man the air trembled with the bellowing of cattle in the corrals	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0002.flac	seemingly but a moment later the cooks howl brought me to consciousness again	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0003.flac	three were to care for the remuda five were to move the stray herd from the corrals to good feed three branding crews were told to brand the calves we had collected in the cut of the afternoon before that took up about half the men	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0004.flac	the rest were to make a short drive in the salt grass	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0005.flac	we were the only ones who did go afoot however although the corrals were not more than two hundred yards distant	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0006.flac	between the upright bars of greasewood we could see the cattle and near the opposite side the men building a fire next the fence	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0007.flac	we pushed open the wide gate and entered	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0008.flac	one stood waiting for them to finish a sheaf of long j h stamping irons in his hand	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0009.flac	all the rest squatted on their heels along the fence smoking cigarettes and chatting together	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0010.flac	the first rays of the sun slanted across in one great sweep from the remote mountains	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0011.flac	homer wooden and old california john rode in among the cattle	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0012.flac	as the loop settled he jerked sharply upward exactly as one would strike to hook a big fish	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0013.flac	homer wrapped the rope twice or thrice about the horn and sat over in one stirrup to avoid the tightened line and to preserve the balance	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0014.flac	nobody paid any attention to the calf	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0015.flac	behind him followed his anxious mother her head swinging from side to side near the fire the horse stopped	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0016.flac	the two bull doggers immediately pounced upon the victim	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0017.flac	it was promptly flopped over on its right side	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0018.flac	thus the calf was unable to struggle	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0019.flac	when once you have had the wind knocked out of you or a rib or two broken you cease to think this unnecessarily rough	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0020.flac	hot iron yelled one of the bull doggers	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0021.flac	marker yelled the other	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0022.flac	the brander pressed the iron smoothly against the flank	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0023.flac	perhaps the calf blatted a little as the heat scorched	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0024.flac	the brand showed cherry which is the proper colour to indicate due peeling and a successful mark	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0025.flac	then he nicked out a swallow tail in the other	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0026.flac	it seems to me that a great deal of unnecessary twaddle is abroad as to the extreme cruelty of branding	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0027.flac	undoubtedly it is to some extent painful and could some other method of ready identification be devised it might be as well to adopt it in preference	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0028.flac	inextinguishable laughter followed the spread of this doctrine through arizona	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0029.flac	imagine a puncher descending to examine politely the ear tags of wild cattle on the open range or in a round up	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0030.flac	a calf usually bellows when the iron bites but as soon as released he almost invariably goes to feeding or to looking idly about	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0031.flac	besides which it happens but once in a lifetime and is over in ten seconds a comfort denied to those of us who have our teeth filled	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0032.flac	one of the little animals was but a few months old so the rider did not bother with its hind legs but tossed his loop over its neck	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0033.flac	mister frosts bull calf alone in pictorial history shows the attitudes	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0034.flac	and then of course there was the gorgeous contrast between all this frantic and uncomprehending excitement and the absolute matter of fact imperturbability of horse and rider	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0035.flac	as he knew his business and as the calf was a small one the little beast went over promptly bit the ground with a whack and was pounced upon and held	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0036.flac	he would catch himself on one foot scramble vigorously and end by struggling back to the upright	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0037.flac	you can imagine what happened next	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0038.flac	this is productive of some fun if it fails	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0039.flac	by now the branding was in full swing	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0040.flac	when the nooses fell they turned and walked toward the fire as a matter of course rarely did the cast fail	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0041.flac	men ran to and fro busy and intent	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0042.flac	sometimes three or four calves were on the ground at once	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0043.flac	dust eddied and dissipated	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0044.flac	no more necked calves they announced	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0045.flac	then he would spit on his hands and go at it alone	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0046.flac	if luck attended his first effort his sarcasm was profound theres yore little calf said he	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0047.flac	would you like to have me tote it to you or do you reckon you could toddle this far with yore little old iron	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0048.flac	toward noon the work slacked	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0049.flac	finally homer rode over to the cattleman and reported the branding finished	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0050.flac	the latter counted the marks in his tally book	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0051.flac	one hundred and seventy six he announced	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0052.flac	the markers squatted on their heels told over the bits of ears they had saved	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0053.flac	the total amounted to but an hundred and seventy five	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0054.flac	finally wooden discovered it in his hip pocket	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0055.flac	they had been doing a wrestlers heavy work all the morning but did not seem to be tired	6841
dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0056.flac	i saw once in some crank physical culture periodical that a cowboys life was physically ill balanced like an oarsmans in that it exercised only certain muscles of the body	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0000.flac	at this moment the heavy beat of the storm on the roof ceased with miraculous suddenness leaving the outside world empty of sound save for the drip drip drip of eaves	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0001.flac	we had every sort of people with us off and on and as i was lookout at a popular game i saw them all	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0002.flac	at the same instant i heard the rip of steel through cloth and felt a sharp stab in my left leg	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0003.flac	then i scouted to see what had cut me and found that the fellow had lost a hand	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0004.flac	in place of it he wore a sharp steel hook	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0005.flac	there was no doubt of his being alive for he was breathing hard like a man does when he gets hit over the head it didnt sound good	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0006.flac	when a man breathes that way hes mostly all gone	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0007.flac	men got batted over the head often enough in those days	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0008.flac	sour wine is fine to put a wound in shape to heal but its no soothing syrup	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0009.flac	their coffin was their ship and their grave it was the sea blow high blow low what care we and the quarter that we gave them was to sink them in the sea down on the coast of the high barbaree	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0010.flac	it fair made my hair rise to hear him with the big still solemn desert outside and the quiet moonlight and the shadows and him sitting up straight and gaunt his eyes blazing each side his big eagle nose and his snaky hair hanging over the raw cut across his head	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0011.flac	however i made out to get him bandaged up and in shape and pretty soon he sort of went to sleep	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0012.flac	then again hed sing that barbaree song until id go out and look at the old colorado flowing by just to be sure i hadnt died and gone below or else hed just talk	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0013.flac	he began when he was a kid and he gave his side of conversations pausing for replies	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0014.flac	i used to listen by the hour but i never made out anything really important as to who the man was or where hed come from or what hed done	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0015.flac	i didnt pay any attention to him for he was quiet	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0016.flac	usually i didnt bother with his talk for it didnt mean anything but something in his voice made me turn	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0017.flac	he was lying on his side those black eyes of his blazing at me but now both of them saw the same distance	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0018.flac	where are my clothes he asked very intense	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0019.flac	one little squeeze talk about your deadly weapons	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0020.flac	but hed been too sick and too long abed	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0021.flac	in a minute or so he came to	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0022.flac	now youre a nice sweet proposition said i as soon as i was sure he could understand me	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0023.flac	theyre safe enough let me have them he begged	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0024.flac	now look here said i you cant get up to day you aint fit	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0025.flac	i know he pleaded but let me see them	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0026.flac	just to satisfy him i passed over his old duds	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0027.flac	ive been robbed he cried	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0028.flac	wheres my coat he asked	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0029.flac	you had no coat when i picked you up i replied	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0030.flac	he looked at me mighty suspicious but didnt say anything more he wouldnt even answer when i spoke to him	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0031.flac	after hed eaten a fair meal he fell asleep	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0032.flac	when i came back that evening the bunk was empty and he was gone	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0033.flac	i didnt see him again for two days	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0034.flac	then i caught sight of him quite a ways off	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0035.flac	guess he suspicions i stole that old coat of his thinks i and afterwards i found that my surmise had been correct	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0036.flac	however he didnt stay long in that frame of mind	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0037.flac	i ran up pulling my gun	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0038.flac	the mex was flat on his face his arms stretched out	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0039.flac	on the middle of his back knelt my one armed friend	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0040.flac	anyway i thrust the muzzle of my colts into the sailors face whats this i asked	6841

dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0042.flac	the gleam died from his eye the snarl left his lips	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0043.flac	in any case he flew poco pronto leaving me and my friend together	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0044.flac	during the next two months he was a good deal about town mostly doing odd jobs i saw him off and on	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0045.flac	however i didnt pay much attention to that being at the time almighty busy holding down my card games	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0046.flac	thats all right said i but you better stay right there	6841

dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0049.flac	he looked all right enough neither drunk nor loco	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0050.flac	sit down said i over there the other side the table	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0051.flac	he did so now fire away said i	6841

dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0054.flac	that may all be true said i but why do you tell me	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0055.flac	why dont you get your treasure without the need of dividing it	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0056.flac	why mate he answered its just plain gratitude	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0057.flac	didnt you save my life and nuss me and take care of me when i was nigh killed	6841

dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0059.flac	its all very well to say gratitude but that dont go with me	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0060.flac	the devils a preacher if you aint lost your pinfeathers said he	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0061.flac	well its this then i got to have a boat to get there and she must be stocked	6841

dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0064.flac	why me i asked why not he retorted	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0065.flac	we talked the matter over at length	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0066.flac	i stood out for a larger party	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0067.flac	he strongly opposed this as depreciating the shares but i had no intention of going alone into what was then considered a wild and dangerous country finally we compromised	6841
dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0068.flac	a third of the treasure was to go to him a third to me and the rest was to be divided among the men whom i should select this scheme did not appeal to him	6841

dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0001.flac	perhaps after a while ill get used to it but im afraid concerts spoil people for everyday life	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0002.flac	i suppose that is why marilla disapproves of them	700

dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0020.flac	i read it to marilla and she said it was stuff and nonsense	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0021.flac	its a sad sweet story	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0022.flac	cordelia was a regal brunette with a coronet of midnight hair and duskly flashing eyes	700

dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0025.flac	i asked ruby gillis if she knew anything about how men proposed because i thought shed likely be an authority on the subject having so many sisters married	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0026.flac	but she pretended to be geraldines friend the same as ever	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0027.flac	let you and me have a story club all our own and write stories for practice	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0028.flac	you ought to cultivate your imagination you know miss stacy says so	700

dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0030.flac	this was how the story club came into existence	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0031.flac	no boys were allowed in it although ruby gillis opined that their admission would make it more exciting and each member had to produce one story a week	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0032.flac	each girl has to read her story out loud and then we talk it over	700

dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0034.flac	im sure that must have a wholesome effect	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0035.flac	the moral is the great thing mister allan says so	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0036.flac	i read one of my stories to him and missus allan and they both agreed that the moral was excellent	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0037.flac	jane and ruby almost always cry when i come to the pathetic parts	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0038.flac	miss josephine barry wrote back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0039.flac	im sure missus allan was never such a silly forgetful little girl as you are	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0040.flac	i felt so encouraged when i heard that	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0041.flac	missus lynde says she always feels shocked when she hears of anyone ever having been naughty no matter how small they were	700
dev-other/700/122866/700-122866-0042.flac	now i wouldnt have felt that way	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0000.flac	vanity and vexation of spirit	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0001.flac	the spring was abroad in the land and marillas sober middle aged step was lighter and swifter because of its deep primal gladness	700

dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0003.flac	perhaps youre judging her too hasty marilla	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0004.flac	of course i knew youd take her part matthew but im bringing her up not you	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0005.flac	demanded marilla anxiously going over to the bed	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0006.flac	anne cowered deeper into her pillows as if desirous of hiding herself forever from mortal eyes no	700

dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0008.flac	this minute i say there now what is it	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0009.flac	anne had slid to the floor in despairing obedience	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0010.flac	yes its green moaned anne	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0011.flac	i thought nothing could be as bad as red hair	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0012.flac	you havent got into any scrape for over two months and i was sure another one was due	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0013.flac	now then what did you do to your hair	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0014.flac	anne shirley didnt you know it was a wicked thing to do	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0015.flac	yes i knew it was a little wicked admitted anne	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0016.flac	i know what it feels like to have your word doubted	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0017.flac	and missus allan says we should never suspect anyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that theyre not	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0018.flac	but i hadnt then and i believed every word he said implicitly	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0019.flac	who said who are you talking about	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0020.flac	oh i didnt let him in the house	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0021.flac	in a trice i saw myself with beautiful raven black hair and the temptation was irresistible	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0022.flac	oh marilla what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0023.flac	your hair must be cut off there is no other way you cant go out with it looking like that	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0024.flac	with a dismal sigh she went for the scissors	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0025.flac	but there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because youve dyed it a dreadful color is there	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0026.flac	im going to weep all the time youre cutting it off if it wont interfere	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0027.flac	it seems such a tragic thing	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0028.flac	anne wept then but later on when she went upstairs and looked in the glass she was calm with despair	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0029.flac	yes i will too	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0030.flac	i never thought i was vain about my hair of all things but now i know i was in spite of its being red because it was so long and thick and curly	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0031.flac	i expect something will happen to my nose next	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0032.flac	annes clipped head made a sensation in school on the following monday but to her relief nobody guessed the real reason for it not even josie pye who however did not fail to inform anne that she looked like a perfect scarecrow	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0033.flac	its hard to be told you look like a scarecrow and i wanted to say something back but i didnt	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0034.flac	it makes you feel very virtuous when you forgive people doesnt it	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0035.flac	i mean to devote all my energies to being good after this and i shall never try to be beautiful again	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0036.flac	of course its better to be good	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0037.flac	i do really want to be good marilla like you and missus allan and miss stacy and grow up to be a credit to you	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0038.flac	diana says when my hair begins to grow to tie a black velvet ribbon around my head with a bow at one side	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0039.flac	i will call it a snood that sounds so romantic	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0040.flac	my head is better now	700
dev-other/700/122867/700-122867-0041.flac	it was terrible bad this afternoon though	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0000.flac	of course you must be elaine anne said diana	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0001.flac	of course it would be romantic conceded jane andrews but i know i couldnt keep still	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0002.flac	but its so ridiculous to have a redheaded elaine mourned anne	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0003.flac	and elaine was the lily maid	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0004.flac	your complexion is just as fair as rubys said diana earnestly and your hair is ever so much darker than it used to be before you cut it	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0005.flac	it was splendid to fish for trout over the bridge and the two girls learned to row themselves about in the little flat bottomed dory mister barry kept for duck shooting	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0006.flac	it was annes idea that they dramatize elaine	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0007.flac	those days she said were so much more romantic than the present	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0008.flac	they had often gone down like this and nothing could be more convenient for playing elaine	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0009.flac	the black shawl having been procured anne spread it over the flat and then lay down on the bottom with closed eyes and hands folded over her breast	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0010.flac	it spoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before missus lynde was born	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0011.flac	jane you arrange this	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0012.flac	its silly for elaine to be talking when shes dead	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0013.flac	jane rose to the occasion	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0014.flac	left behind at the landing	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0015.flac	anne gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard she was white to the lips but she did not lose her self possession	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0016.flac	there was one chance just one	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0017.flac	under such circumstances you dont think much about making a flowery prayer	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0018.flac	the flat drifted under the bridge and then promptly sank in midstream	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0019.flac	ruby jane and diana already awaiting it on the lower headland saw it disappear before their very eyes and had not a doubt but that anne had gone down with it	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0020.flac	the minutes passed by each seeming an hour to the unfortunate lily maid	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0021.flac	why didnt somebody come where had the girls gone	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0022.flac	her imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome possibilities to her	700

dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0024.flac	how on earth did you get there he exclaimed	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0025.flac	it was certainly extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0026.flac	what has happened anne	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0027.flac	asked gilbert taking up his oars	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0028.flac	we were playing elaine explained anne frigidly without even looking at her rescuer and i had to drift down to camelot in the barge i mean the flat	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0029.flac	for a moment anne hesitated	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0030.flac	her heart gave a quick queer little beat	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0031.flac	her resentment which to other and older people might be as laughable as its cause was in no whit allayed and softened by time seemingly	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0032.flac	no she said coldly i shall never be friends with you gilbert blythe and i dont want to be	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0033.flac	all right	700

dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0035.flac	of course he had insulted her terribly but still	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0036.flac	everything i do gets me or my dearest friends into a scrape	700
dev-other/700/122868/700-122868-0037.flac	annes presentiment proved more trustworthy than presentiments are apt to do	700

dev-other/7601/101619/7601-101619-0003.flac	nature discovers this confusion to us painters hold that the same motions and grimaces of the face that serve for weeping serve for laughter too and indeed before the one or the other be finished do but observe the painters manner of handling and you will be in doubt to which of the two the design tends and the extreme of laughter does at last bring tears	7601

dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0012.flac	he went on thus till he came to a vale where he saw three men who were in a sound sleep with chains on their feet	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0013.flac	christian sirs whence come you and where do you go	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0014.flac	formalist and hypocrisy we were born in the land of vain glory and are on our way to mount zion for praise	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0015.flac	know you not that he that comes not in at the door but climbs up to get in the same is a thief	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0016.flac	they told christian that he had no need for care on that score for long use had made it law and they could prove that it had been so for years	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0017.flac	yes said they no doubt of it	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0018.flac	and if we get in the road at all pray what are the odds	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0019.flac	is not our case as good as yours	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0020.flac	i saw then that they all went on till they came to the foot of the hill of difficulty where there was a spring	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0021.flac	now when christian got as far as the spring of life he drank of it and then went up the hill	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0022.flac	now half way up was a cave made by the lord of that hill that those who came by might rest there	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0023.flac	timorous said that zion was the hill they meant to climb but that when they had got half way they found that they met with more and more risk so that great fear came on them and all they could do was to turn back	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0024.flac	yes said mistrust for just in front of us there lay two beasts of prey in our path we knew not if they slept or not but we thought that they would fall on us and tear our limbs	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0025.flac	yet he thought once more of what he had heard from the men and then he felt in his cloak for his scroll that he might read it and find some peace	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0026.flac	he felt for it but found it not	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0027.flac	so he fell down on his knees to pray that god would give him grace for this act and then went back to look for his scroll	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0028.flac	oh fool that i am said he to sleep in the day time so to give way to the flesh as to use for ease that rest which the lord of the hill had made but for the help of the soul	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0029.flac	such was the lot of the jews for their sin they were sent back by the way of the red sea and i am made to tread those steps with grief which i might have trod with joy had it not been for this sleep	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0030.flac	how far might i have been on my way by this time	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0031.flac	now by this time he had come to the vale once more where for a spell he sat down and wept but at last as he cast a sad glance at the foot of the bench he saw his scroll which he caught up with haste and put in his cloak	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0032.flac	words are too weak to tell the joy of christian when he had got back his scroll	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0033.flac	he laid it up in the breast of his coat and gave thanks to god	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0034.flac	with what a light step did he now climb the hill	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0035.flac	ah thought he these beasts range in the night for their prey and if they should meet with me in the dark how should i fly from them	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0036.flac	the name of the man who kept the lodge of that house was watchful and when he saw that christian made a halt as if he would go back he came out to him and said is thy strength so small	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0037.flac	fear not the two wild beasts for they are bound by chains and are put here to try the faith of those that have it and to find out those that have none	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0038.flac	keep in the midst of the path and no harm shall come to thee	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0039.flac	then i saw in my dream that still he went on in great dread of the wild beasts he heard them roar yet they did him no harm but when he had gone by them he went on with joy till he came and stood in front of the lodge where watchful dwelt	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0040.flac	christian sir what house is this may i rest here to night	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0041.flac	when watchful told her why christian had come there she said what is your name	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0042.flac	then christian bent down his head and went with them to the house	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0043.flac	piety come good christian since our love prompts us to take you in to rest let us talk with you of all that you have seen on your way	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0044.flac	christian with a right good will and i am glad that you should ask it of me	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0045.flac	prudence and first say what is it that makes you wish so much to go to mount zion	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0046.flac	there they say is no death and there i shall dwell with such as love the lord	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0047.flac	charity have you a wife and babes christian yes i have	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0048.flac	charity and why did you not bring them with you	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0049.flac	but they would not come with me nor have me leave them	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0050.flac	thus did christian talk with these friends till it grew dark and then he took his rest in a large room the name of which was peace there he slept till break of day and then he sang a hymn	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0051.flac	and they brought out the jaw bone of an ass with which samson did such great feats and the sling and stone with which david slew goliath of gath	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0052.flac	what is the name of this land said christian	7697
dev-other/7697/105815/7697-105815-0053.flac	then they told him it was immanuels land	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0000.flac	more than this he hath been heard to rail on you my lord who are now his judge	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0001.flac	judge thy just doom would be to die on the spot still let us hear what thou hast to say	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0002.flac	then the judge to sum up the case spoke thus you see this man who has made such a stir in our town	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0003.flac	thus while one lost his life for the truth a new man rose from his death to tread the same way with christian	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0004.flac	come good hopeful said christian let us walk on the grass	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0005.flac	so they set off through the field	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0006.flac	hopeful i had my fears from the first and so gave you a hint christian good friend i grieve that i have brought you out of the right path	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0007.flac	hopeful say no more no doubt it is for our good	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0008.flac	christian we must not stand thus let us try to go back	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0009.flac	then said giant despair you have no right to force your way in here the ground on which you lie is mine	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0010.flac	they had not much to say as they knew that they were in fault	7697
dev-other/7697/105817/7697-105817-0011.flac	and by this act we kill our souls as well	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0000.flac	four whether in that state man would have been master over men	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0001.flac	therefore in the state of innocence man had no mastership of the animals	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0002.flac	therefore in the state of innocence before man had disobeyed nothing disobeyed him that was naturally subject to him	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0003.flac	secondly this is proved by the order of divine providence which always governs inferior things by the superior	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0004.flac	thirdly this is proved from a property of man and of other animals	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0005.flac	now whatever is participated is subject to what is essential and universal	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0006.flac	therefore the subjection of other animals to man is proved to be natural	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0007.flac	they would not however on this account have been excepted from the mastership of man as neither at present are they for that reason excepted from the mastership of god whose providence has ordained all this	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0008.flac	this is signified by the fact that god led the animals to man that he might give them names expressive of their respective natures	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0009.flac	so all animals would have obeyed man of their own accord as in the present state some domestic animals obey him	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0010.flac	objection one it would seem that in the state of innocence man would not have had mastership over all other creatures	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0011.flac	much less therefore would it have obeyed man in the state of innocence	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0012.flac	therefore since it is by his reason that man is competent to have mastership it seems that in the state of innocence man had no dominion over plants	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0013.flac	now in man reason has the position of a master and not of a subject	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0014.flac	i answer that we must needs admit that in the primitive state there would have been some inequality at least as regards sex because generation depends upon diversity of sex and likewise as regards age for some would have been born of others nor would sexual union have been sterile	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0015.flac	there might also have been bodily disparity	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0016.flac	inequality might also arise on the part of nature as above described without any defect of nature	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0017.flac	objection one it would seem that in the state of innocence man would not have been master over man	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0018.flac	therefore in the state of innocence man would not have been subject to man	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0019.flac	in another sense mastership is referred in a general sense to any kind of subject and in this sense even he who has the office of governing and directing free men can be called a master	7697
dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0020.flac	such a kind of mastership would have existed in the state of innocence between man and man for two reasons	7697
dev-other/7697/245715/7697-245715-0000.flac	but in the state of innocence there would have been no weakness of old age	7697
dev-other/7697/245715/7697-245715-0001.flac	on the contrary everything generated is first imperfect but in the state of innocence children would have been begotten by generation	7697
dev-other/7697/245715/7697-245715-0002.flac	therefore from the first they would have been imperfect in bodily size and power	7697
dev-other/7697/245715/7697-245715-0003.flac	therefore in the state of innocence there was no need for women to be born on the contrary natures process in generation would have been in harmony with the manner in which it was established by god	7697
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0000.flac	i have been told that mister van brandt is in prison for debt i said	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0001.flac	and i saw for myself last night that he had left you helpless	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0002.flac	he left me the little money he had with him when he was arrested she rejoined sadly	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0003.flac	his cruel creditors are more to blame than he is for the poverty that has fallen on us	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0004.flac	even this negative defense of van brandt stung me to the quick i ought to have spoken more guardedly of him i said bitterly	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0005.flac	i ought to have remembered that a woman can forgive almost any wrong that a man can inflict on her when he is the man whom she loves	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0006.flac	she put her hand on my mouth and stopped me before i could say any more	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0007.flac	how can you speak so cruelly to me she asked	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0008.flac	you know to my shame i confessed it to you the last time we met you know that my heart in secret is all yours	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0009.flac	what wrong are you talking of	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0010.flac	is it the wrong i suffered when van brandt married me with a wife living at the time and living still	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0011.flac	do you think i can ever forget the great misfortune of my life the misfortune that has made me unworthy of you	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0012.flac	it is no fault of mine god knows but it is not the less true that i am not married and that the little darling who is playing out there with her doll is my child	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0013.flac	and you talk of my being your wife knowing that the child accepts me as her second father i said	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0014.flac	it would be better and happier for us both if you had as little pride as the child pride she repeated	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0015.flac	in such a position as mine	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0016.flac	a helpless woman with a mock husband in prison for debt	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0017.flac	am i to marry you for my food and shelter	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0018.flac	am i to marry you because there is no lawful tie that binds me to the father of my child	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0019.flac	bad as he is he has not forsaken me he has been forced away	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0020.flac	my only friend is it possible that you think me ungrateful enough to consent to be your wife	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0021.flac	the woman in my situation must be heartless indeed who could destroy your place in the estimation of the world and the regard of your friends	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0022.flac	the wretchedest creature that walks the streets would shrink from treating you in that way	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0023.flac	oh what are men made of	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0024.flac	how can you how can you speak of it	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0025.flac	i yielded and spoke of it no more	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0026.flac	every word she uttered only increased my admiration of the noble creature whom i had loved and lost	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0027.flac	bitterly as i hated the man who had parted us i loved her dearly enough to be even capable of helping him for her sake hopeless infatuation	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0028.flac	i dont deny it i dont excuse it hopeless infatuation you have forgiven me i said	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0029.flac	let me deserve to be forgiven	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0030.flac	it is something to be your only friend	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0031.flac	you must have plans for the future tell me unreservedly how i can help you	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0032.flac	complete the good work that you have begun she answered gratefully help me back to health	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0033.flac	make me strong enough to submit to a doctors estimate of my chances of living for some years yet	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0034.flac	a doctors estimate of your chances of living i repeated what do you mean	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0035.flac	i hardly know how to tell you she said without speaking again of mister van brandt	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0036.flac	does speaking of him again mean speaking of his debts i asked	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0037.flac	why need you hesitate	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0038.flac	you know that there is nothing i will not do to relieve your anxieties	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0039.flac	never let me tell you the plain truth	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0040.flac	there is a serious necessity for his getting out of prison	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0041.flac	yes this is his position in two words a little while since he obtained an excellent offer of employment abroad from a rich relative of his and he had made all his arrangements to accept it	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0042.flac	unhappily he returned to tell me of his good fortune and the same day he was arrested for debt	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0043.flac	the snare that had been set for her was plainly revealed in those four words	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0044.flac	in the eye of the law she was of course a single woman she was of age she was to all intents and purposes her own mistress	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0045.flac	what was there to prevent her from insuring her life if she pleased and from so disposing of the insurance as to give van brandt a direct interest in her death	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0046.flac	thanks to the happy accident of my position the one certain way of protecting her lay easily within my reach	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0047.flac	i could offer to lend the scoundrel the money that he wanted at an hours notice and he was the man to accept my proposal quite as easily as i could make it	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0048.flac	you are quite mistaken i replied	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0049.flac	i am only doubting whether your plan for relieving mister van brandt of his embarrassments is quite so simple as you suppose	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0050.flac	are you aware of the delays that are likely to take place before it will be possible to borrow money on your policy of insurance	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0051.flac	i know nothing about it she said sadly	8173

dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0056.flac	i could honestly promise that	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0057.flac	my one chance of saving her lay in keeping from her knowledge the course that i had now determined to pursue	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0058.flac	i rose to go while my resolution still sustained me	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0059.flac	kiss me she whispered before you go	8173
dev-other/8173/294714/8173-294714-0060.flac	it is only your goodness that overpowers me	8173
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0000.flac	the next day everybody in the house began to make preparations for the journey	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0001.flac	everything was done very leisurely though there was a lot of talking and disputing and the giving of contrary orders	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0002.flac	the old porter was there directing and scolding the servants as they piled the rugs and blankets and bags of food and pots and pans and dishes into the wagon	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0003.flac	there was quite a procession when at last the big wagon rumbled out through the gateway	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0004.flac	behind it came the grandmother in her dhoolie dak a sort of a litter or easy chair swung between two long poles	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0005.flac	besides the family there were many servants and several others walked beside the slow moving wagon	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0006.flac	the cook too went with them	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0007.flac	good bye shouted little nao from his garden wall as they went by good bye	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0008.flac	they shouted greetings to their friend the potter as they passed him and also to the old fakir smeared all over with ashes who sat in a little brick hut by the bridge and pretended to make wonderful cures	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0009.flac	this is more fun than going to school said chola as the oxen plodded along through clouds of dust	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0010.flac	these lovely birds are found nearly everywhere in india and in some parts run quite wild	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0011.flac	his long matted hair hung on his shoulders and he was saying his prayers with the help of a rosary of beads which he continually passed through his hands	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0012.flac	as the wagon came up a young man who accompanied the holy man ran up and held out a begging bowl saying give oh charitable people to this holy one	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0013.flac	no country in the world has so many beggars as india	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0014.flac	many of them are called holy men because they do nothing but make pilgrimages from one sacred place to another living solely on the alms that are given to them	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0015.flac	when they had eaten their lunch the young people went to explore the garden near them	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0016.flac	perhaps there are dogs said mahala a little fearfully but they forgot about dogs when they saw a thicket of sugar cane down by a stream	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0017.flac	perhaps we can buy some from the man there he is now ploughing by the stream said chola	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0018.flac	it is looking for water said the farmer as he took a long stalk of cane and gently guided it down to the stream	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0019.flac	the snake is another sacred animal of the hindus and they would not kill or injure one for anything	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0020.flac	as they were about to move on again they saw a great cloud of dust down the road	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0021.flac	it turned out that it was a great and powerful rajah going in state on a journey to visit another rajah or ruler of one of the small kingdoms or states of which modern india was formerly made up	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0022.flac	first there came a big elephant all decorated with silk and gold and silver	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0023.flac	on the elephants back was a howdah which is like a big chair with a canopy over it and in this sitting cross legged was the rajah a big fat fellow dressed in coloured silks and jewels with a great diamond set plume in his turban	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0024.flac	behind the howdah stood a servant holding a big umbrella of fine feathers over the rajahs head	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0025.flac	the driver sat on the neck of the elephant and guided the big beast by prodding him on one side or the other with an iron shod stick or goad	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0026.flac	isnt it fine to ride like that on a big elephant	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0027.flac	and all the rest of the day the little folk talked of nothing but the great rajah and his escort	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0028.flac	our party came to a halt among many other bullock carts the owners of which were already sitting around on the ground cooking their suppers or bargaining for food at the little booths	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0029.flac	these they used for plates heaping them up with their boiled rice and curry and fish and all sorts of puddings and sweets	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0030.flac	as supper was being eaten another party stopped at the parao and camped not far away	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0031.flac	when the litter was put down a young boy stepped out looking very proud and haughty	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0032.flac	his servants at once spread a handsome rug on the ground for him to sit on and rushed about waiting on him taking good care to keep every one at a distance	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0033.flac	yes and how he orders every one about him	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0034.flac	around the little brahmins neck was a thin cord or thread which was the sign of his high caste	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0035.flac	meanwhile the haughty little brahmin ate his supper with his head turned away so no one could see him eat and then growing tired of respectful glances of the crowd around him he got into his litter again and the servants fastened the curtains tightly around him	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0036.flac	everybody slept soundly in spite of the fact that one of the servants was beating a drum most of the night which they really believed was the way to keep off evil spirits	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0037.flac	oh the thieves he cried	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0038.flac	they are as bad as the beggars	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0039.flac	what art thou guarding so carefully shriya asked her brother	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0040.flac	he and chola were walking beside the wagon for a change	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0041.flac	the lattices were raised so shriya and her mother and aunt could enjoy the fresh air	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0042.flac	they are my dolls said the little girl sadly as she patted the bundle beside her	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0043.flac	i take them as an offering to the holy river poor little woman	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0044.flac	must thou sacrifice thy toys too	8254
dev-other/8254/115543/8254-115543-0045.flac	smiled her uncle as he patted her head	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0000.flac	chapter forty nine griggs is stubborn	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0001.flac	the days glided by with the stiffness in chris lees limbs growing less painful and the pony recovering fast for the clear mountain air seemed to act like a cure for wounds	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0002.flac	every day that came showed the injured animal in better condition	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0003.flac	its efforts to move no longer made chris wince and forget his own pains in those he felt at seeing the mustang suffer	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0004.flac	every one was busy for the keeping watch regularly took up a good deal of time	8254

dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0029.flac	being shot at by fellows with bows and arrows sounds bad enough but theres not much risk here	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0030.flac	i dont know about that said chris anxiously	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0031.flac	dont you well i do	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0032.flac	i should be running fast and dodging in and out among the rocks and trees	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0033.flac	but the enemy wont be standing still continued griggs	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0034.flac	i dont believe theres a bit of risk for me i shall be all right	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0035.flac	but our animals will be well back in that hollow said chris	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0036.flac	yes my lad but i want them to be planted farther back still	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0037.flac	im afraid father will say that the ponies ought to be close at hand	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0038.flac	yes thats right if it can be done but it would go hard with us all if the indians gave up the bait of the trap and turned upon those who set it	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0039.flac	well you must talk it over with father said chris	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0040.flac	too many redskins about as i told you	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0041.flac	there are always too many redskins about cried chris impatiently	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0042.flac	i wish we could charge them boldly and send them flying over the plains	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0043.flac	never to come back again said ned sharply	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0044.flac	not quite my lads dont you see that were playing a very ticklish game	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0045.flac	just then the doctor came into the shelter where the boys had been talking bringing with him wilton who had been shooting or rather trying to shoot for he had had no success and they too were talking earnestly about ways and means	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0046.flac	oh here you are griggs cried the doctor	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0047.flac	had a good turn at scouting yes sir	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0048.flac	the indians have shifted their quarters and theyre in about as awkward a position as they could contrive for our purpose	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0049.flac	we must get away from here to some good hunting ground	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0050.flac	do the indians seem to be camping or only on the move	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0051.flac	they seem to me to be hatching up some dodge or another replied griggs	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0052.flac	then he began to walk up and down slowly evidently deep in thought	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0053.flac	there he said ive made up my mind	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0054.flac	it is very evident that we may wait here till our stores are exhausted and be as far off the opportunity we seek as ever	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0055.flac	the indians can wait we cannot and they seem to know it	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0056.flac	going to give up young chriss plan said griggs slowly	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0057.flac	no im going to put it in force at once we start to night	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0058.flac	but all the same we can be making our preparations	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0059.flac	the barrels can be filled with water and every ones bottle	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0060.flac	provisions can be packed in our wallets in fact everything held ready for a start	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0061.flac	finally just at dusk the animals can be driven in for food and water and	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0062.flac	exactly replied the doctor	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0063.flac	but before any more is said griggs i want to offer you the opportunity to draw back	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0064.flac	what for said griggs sharply	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0065.flac	not a bit of it sir im going to take care they dont hit me	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0066.flac	i mean to do a bit to carry out young chriss plan and shut up the redskins for a week or two perhaps a month while we get right away	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0067.flac	there is a horrible side to it griggs	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0068.flac	would be if we let them get the better of us sir	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0069.flac	you mean the shutting up the enemy here to starve	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0070.flac	ejaculated griggs so sharply that the boys started serve em right if they did sir	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0071.flac	what business have they to want our scalps but we shouldnt shut them up to starve	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0072.flac	theyd have weeks of work before they could get their horses out but without horses theyd be out in a week	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0073.flac	starve nonsense	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0074.flac	but there i dont want to make speeches its all settled gentlemen	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0075.flac	but youve got to tell the lookout whats coming off	8254
dev-other/8254/84205/8254-84205-0076.flac	now every one understands that he is to be ready without showing any watchful indian scout that there is something on the way	8254
dev-other/8288/274150/8288-274150-0000.flac	and again when the artist following malicornes advice was a little late in arriving and when saint aignan had been obliged to be absent for some time it was interesting to observe though no one witnessed them those moments of silence full of deep expression which united in one sigh two souls most disposed to understand each other and who by no means objected to the quiet meditation they enjoyed together	8288
dev-other/8288/274150/8288-274150-0001.flac	in a word malicorne philosopher that he was though he knew it not had learned how to inspire the king with an appetite in the midst of plenty and with desire in the assurance of possession	8288
dev-other/8288/274150/8288-274150-0002.flac	in this manner therefore without leaving her room and having no confidante she was able to return to her apartment thus removing by her appearance a little tardy perhaps the suspicions of the most determined skeptics	8288
dev-other/8288/274150/8288-274150-0003.flac	but the door remained closed and neither saint aignan nor the painter appeared nor did the hangings even move	8288
dev-other/8288/274150/8288-274150-0004.flac	go then dearest love said the king but return quickly	8288
dev-other/8288/274150/8288-274150-0005.flac	no no not to day sire	8288
dev-other/8288/274150/8288-274150-0006.flac	i knew but too well that you had not ceased to love me	8288
dev-other/8288/274150/8288-274150-0007.flac	la valliere with a gesture partly of extreme terror and partly as if invoking a blessing attempted to speak but could not articulate one word	8288
dev-other/8288/274150/8288-274150-0008.flac	at the moment however when the king threw himself on his knees a cry of utter despair rang through the corridor accompanied by the sound of retreating footsteps	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0000.flac	the captain sitting buried in his leathern armchair his spurs fixed in the floor his sword between his legs was reading a number of letters as he twisted his mustache	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0001.flac	dartagnan uttered a welcome full of pleasure when he perceived his friends son	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0002.flac	raoul my boy he said by what lucky accident does it happen that the king has recalled you	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0003.flac	these words did not sound agreeably in the young mans ears who as he seated himself replied upon my word i cannot tell you all that i know is i have come back hum	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0004.flac	that the king has not recalled you and you have returned	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0005.flac	i do not understand that at all	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0006.flac	raoul was already pale enough and he now began to turn his hat round and round in his hand	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0007.flac	what the deuce is the matter that you look as you do and what makes you so dumb	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0008.flac	said the captain do people nowadays assume that sort of airs in england	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0009.flac	i have been in england and came here again as lively as a chaffinch	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0010.flac	will you not say something	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0011.flac	i have too much to say	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0012.flac	ah how is your father	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0013.flac	forgive me my dear friend i was going to ask you that	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0014.flac	dartagnan increased the sharpness of his penetrating gaze which no secret was capable of resisting	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0015.flac	you are unhappy about something he said	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0016.flac	i am indeed and you know the reason very well monsieur dartagnan	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0017.flac	nay do not pretend to be astonished	8288

dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0020.flac	she is deceiving you said dartagnan not a muscle of whose face had moved those are big words who makes use of them	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0021.flac	every one ah	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0022.flac	if every one says so there must be some truth in it	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0023.flac	not for a friend for a son	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0024.flac	the deuce take it you are really ill from curiosity	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0025.flac	no it is not from curiosity it is from love	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0026.flac	good another big word	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0027.flac	i tell you i love louise to distraction	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0028.flac	well suppose it were only that	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0029.flac	no sensible man ever succeeded in making much of a brain when the head was turned	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0030.flac	i have completely lost my senses in the same way a hundred times in my life	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0031.flac	you would hear but you would not understand me you would understand but you would not obey me	8288

dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0034.flac	very good i should quarrel with you	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0035.flac	i never complain as you know but as heaven and my father would never forgive me for blowing out my brains i will go and get the first person i meet to give me the information which you withhold i will tell him he lies and and you would kill him	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0036.flac	and a fine affair that would be so much the better what should i care	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0037.flac	you now assume a different tone instead of killing you will get killed yourself i suppose you mean very fine indeed	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0038.flac	how much i should regret you	8288

dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0044.flac	raoul buried his face in his hands murmuring no no i have not a single friend in the world	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0045.flac	idle fancies monsieur i do not laugh at you although i am a gascon	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0046.flac	a carpenter what do you mean	8288

dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0051.flac	but the painter then the portrait	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0052.flac	why you seem to have only that name in your mouth	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0053.flac	i do not suppose it will concern you	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0054.flac	yes you are right and he made a step or two as if he were going to leave where are you going	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0055.flac	to look for some one who will tell me the truth	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0056.flac	who is that a woman	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0057.flac	you wish to be consoled by some one and you will be so at once she will tell you nothing ill of herself of course so be off	8288

dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0059.flac	well i admit it	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0060.flac	and in point of fact why should i play with you as a cat does with a poor mouse	8288

dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0064.flac	ah said raoul snatching eagerly at the pen which the captain held out to him	8288
dev-other/8288/274162/8288-274162-0065.flac	how very fortunate that is he was looking for you too	8288
